<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>I lack the fundamentals of Computer Science, the things every programmer should know: Algo's, Data Structures, Operating Systems an understanding of compilers and being profficient with linux.</i><p>Relax.  That's true for 99% of all programmers.<p><i>Eventually I plan on going back to a real University and getting a CS degree</i><p>Absolutely not necessary.  You will probably learn more building <i>anything</i> than learning it in school.<p><i>I'm starting to think I may have a learning dissability</i><p>Maybe you do, maybe you don't.  Just because the rest of the world is quick to diagnose everything doesn't mean you have to.<p><i>I have come to accept that I'm really not smart. I'm slow, forgetfull, concepts never seem to stick</i><p>Your performance shortcomings could be for many reasons.  Being "really not smart" is the <i>least likely</i> of any of them.  They are much more likely caused by other things like uninteresting work, poor environment, personal issues, nasty people, or even health issues.  Whether you're "smart" or not, thinking that your aren't is pretty much a guarantee for failure.  Please don't do that.<p><i>I have started going through the basic Algo's and Data structures again with a basic Java book about algorithms</i><p>Sorry to say, but you're just doing it the hardest way you can.  You don't need a book; you need a <i>project</i>.  I (like many others here, I'm sure) have achieved much, but have always had difficulty learning from books and theory.  It's hard!  You need to find work where the things you need to learn will be required.  Funny how quickly and easily you'll find a way to learn them when you actually need them.  I'm not sure <i>how</i> you should go about finding such work, but I imagine many responses in this thread do.<p><i>I just don't want to be a cargo cult programmer anymore.</i><p>Good.  That makes your normal.<p><i>And finally trying to memorise all those linux commands I ALWAYS forget.</i><p>Then use less commands.  I have never used more that 10% of what was available in <i>any</i> technology and I always got the job done.<p><i>I have to force myself</i><p>This is the most important thing you have said.<p>Have you ever actually enjoyed building stuff?  Have you ever gotten really "jazzed" about the project you were working on?  Have you ever leapt up out of your seat and danced when you got something working?<p>If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, then you really do have the passion to be a programmer.  Stop selling yourself short and listen to the great advice you're sure to get here from fellow Hacker News'ers.<p>If you answered "yes" to none of these questions, then there's no sense for you to continue wasting your time searching for the passion.  If you haven't experienced any by now, then you probably never will.  No one should have to "force themself" to love what they're doing.  Find something else.<p>P.S.  Sorry about your father.  Loss affects each of us differently.  And don't worry about your English.  It's fine.  Please give yourself your best chance to succeed and keep us posted.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>While I agree with virtually of what you said, the following statement I do disagree with: <i>You don't need a book; you need a project.</i>   (in reference to laerning algo and data structures).<p>There are too many non-trivial algorithms that you are just likely to not rediscover.  Many are the result of some of the best minds in various fields over decades.  Dynamic programming isn't something that will likely just show up in your code w/o knowing about it (it may, but probably among the more skilled). Balanced trees almost certainly won't.  Heck, even standard binary trees probably aren't obvious to someone who hasn't thought about the problem.<p>And definitely not things like the Fast Fourier Transform or stability of Gaussian elimination, etc...<p>I'd at least recommend spending a weekend reading a pragmatic algorithms book like Sedgewick, <a href="http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/Algs4Flyer.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/Algs4Flyer.pdf</a>.<p>Have a project that you're working on too, but don't do it without also learning algorithms and data structures more formally.  Otherwise you'll end up finding a lot of poor solutions for problems that have known good solutions.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2262937 href="vote?for=2262937&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%35%68%63%73%41%4d%42%34%70"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2262937></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=edw519">edw519</a> 344 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2262937">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Let me echo VivTech.  You dont need to memorize all the algorithms and variants,  but you do need to know what is there, so that sometime later when you need a solution, you know where to look.  Also you need to dive deeply into some aspect such as sort or lists so that you get a good feel for big O notation and analysis.  You may never implement a sort or tree algorithm, but is good to know which one to pick when you need it.<p>I've never had to use FFT, but sorts, trees, and graph traversal are pretty common.<p>My introduction to algorithms oh so many moons ago was Sedgewick when it was a single volume in C(?).

This is a real-life example: this is a piece of code in the gnu flex program:<p><pre><code>    /* We sort the states in sns so we

I have about 2 dozen "base programs".  Whenever I need to develop something new, I grab the closest one, "save as" something else and get to work.  I'm always tweaking, improving, and adding to those base programs, kinda like automating my own continuous improvement.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I have a working solution for idonethis.com, a conceptual solution for "Epic Win!", and an additional insight to add to yours.<p>The working solution for idonethis.com is to simply set it as your browser's home page. I live on my laptop, and to a significant extent, my web browser as well. For people in this category, a browser's home page may have even more of an unavoidable visible presence than a wall calendar would, not to mention perhaps even a greater frequency of exposure. This also serves as a call to action, meaning that every time that one opens a tab to, for example, read a news site, they'll see their calendar first and have to consider whether reading the news is more important than the goals that they have set out for themselves. As a side-note, I have no bookmarks for any news or related sites, in order to force a view of the calendar.<p>One thing I can see being a solution for "Epic Win!" would be if it displayed its equivalent of the calendar as the iOS device's lock screen and home screen wallpaper. In this way, you simply can't avoid seeing it.<p>I've found that the key here is actually not in the unavoidability, the key here is reducing the effort required by greatest extent humanely possible. "Epic Win!", in its current state, fails because it takes effort, no matter how minuscule, to launch the app. Getting an automated reminder is great, but it still requires effort, again no matter how minuscule, to click into the body of the email to see the calendar. Using the browser home screen or iOS wallpaper approach means that you're always seeing your calendar as a side-effect of something that you were already doing, and thus itself requires zero intrinsic or additional effort.<p>Finally, I think you brought up a great point in that "not using an app hides away the shame of not using it". The practical effect of having to deal with that shame is that it increases the effort required, due to emotional reconciliation, which decreases the likelihood of the app being launched.<p>When you know that shame is unavoidable (since you'll see it as your wallpaper and/or browser home screen) you can no longer "ignore" the shame (e.g., ignore an email, don't open an app). The only way around not feeling the associated negative emotions is to just ensure that you're executing on the goals that you've set out for yourself.<p>This approach is also supremely motivational from the "carrot" perspective. Seeing your chain of successes, day after day, is profoundly self-affirming, addictive, and habitualizing. You'll get to the point, in a relatively short period of time, where there is simply no force on the face of the planet that will prevent you from continuing your streak.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2263191 href="vote?for=2263191&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%35%68%63%73%41%4d%42%34%70"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2263191></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ekanes">ekanes</a> 344 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2263191">link</a></span></div><br>

It's one thing to say 'hey, I've built some really nice online calendar syncing software', it's another to pull out a tablet, load up your account in the calendar and quickly show him creating a couple of events and inviting people and get him seeing just how usable and fast it is.<p>In fact, I think this, more than anything, is the 'killer app' for tablets - as Tim Bray said, they're a 'shareable' computer, and being able to quickly demo stuff live is invaluable.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2262085 href="vote?for=2262085&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%35%68%63%73%41%4d%42%34%70"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2262085></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=JshWright">JshWright</a> 344 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2262085">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Co-signed - fellow free hacker.<p>You're not alone.  I realised that Facebook makes it possible for completely non-computery people to share pictures, write notes, have on-line conversations, have a sort-of blog, all in a one-stop shop.  When my older niece started to use it I realised that there were half a dozen other facilities that would serve her better, but it's the 80/20 rule.  For essentially zero effort she got more than she otherwise could have.<p>I sigh, but it's the way it is.  It's the way it was with AOL, and maybe something will kill it eventually, but it's the way it is now.<p>I look forward to seeing where it will go, and I hope it's better than anything we can currently imagine.<p>It probably will.<p>ADDED IN EDIT:<p>When I clicked the link I got:<p><pre><code>    You are using an incompatible web browser.

So it's probably more practical to learn which habits to emulate and which to avoid in those we actually do encounter.<p>For example, that database whiz may suck at algoritms, so just because you learned one great thing from him, it does not necessarily follow that you should learn others.  Also, I have often found a big difference between the perceptions of others (especially bosses and users) and my own assessment of their skills.<p>There is something to be learned from everyone.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Exactly, 'careful' implies that you are a powerless sheep - which is actually true for an alarming percentage of the population.<p>I think Paul Buchheit's recent article 'Two paths to success' does a very good job of illustrating the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.  Seems like one's personal ratio of extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation can be used as a sort of co-efficient that limits or enhances how you are influenced by your network.  Further, if you pick some of the most intrinsically motivated entrepreneurs and innovators, you will find many people who will actually be affected negatively by what their network is doing.<p>In my opinion, for the sake of innovation, the world needs far more entrepreneurs and technologists who are highly intrinsically motivated, and far far less people who are so impressionable that the need to be 'careful' about who they work with.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>To me, that is the surest indicator of a bubble-like market. I think some of the recent valuations for companies with many users but no profit nor any obvious business model are dubious at best. However, I think the valuations for companies that depend exclusively on one framework/inftrastructure base provided by another mega-valued company are downright crazy. Companies like Facebook have come and gone before, and when they go, they often disappear into relative obscurity pretty quickly after losing critical mass. Investing heavily in a company built on that foundation is compounding two very high risk strategies, which doesn't sound very smart to me. But then, I'm not a billionaire VC, so maybe I just don't get it. :-)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2256028 href="vote?for=2256028&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%35%68%63%73%41%4d%42%34%70"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2256028></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jacques_chester">jacques_chester</a> 346 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2256028">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Yes and no. If the companies in question are privately held then to a certain extent the risk is only with investors brave (or foolish) enough to back them. However, what do you think would happen to the tech industry, and potentially the wider world economy, if a big name company suddenly went up in smoke, public or otherwise?<p>Now, please pause for a moment and consider: it doesn't have to be Microsoft or Apple or Oracle. Some of the crazy valuations are putting much less robust companies within an order of magnitude. If one of them goes, it's going to be big news and stock prices right across hi-tech industry could race to the bottom scarily fast as we've seen before.<p>If you are, for example, Zynga, then the kind of disaster that could lead to catastrophic failure seems awfully difficult for you to anticipate or control. Likewise all kinds of new companies being built on Twitter and so on, keeping in mind that Twitter (as far as I know) doesn't actually make any money itself yet and could easily be displaced by the next new shiny thing tomorrow.<p>I'm not saying it's going to happen at all, never mind tomorrow, but there is definitely a house of cards building up here, and of such things, market bubbles are made.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2256574 href="vote?for=2256574&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%35%68%63%73%41%4d%42%34%70"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2256574></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dman">dman</a> 345 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2256574">link</a></span></div><br>

That <i>can</i> mean that products consumers have paid good money for can effectively just be switched off arbitrarily, and that's why I don't personally buy things that are DRM'd in such a way.<p>Developing for mobile platforms can be similarly risky. For example, my startup has no current plans to build an iPhone app, even though our users might appreciate it. We simply don't trust that Apple will not just arbitrarily squish us and not even notice/care based on their track record to date, and we would rather invest our money in safe platforms like the web.
