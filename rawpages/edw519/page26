I'd like to say that this has been borne out by my professional performance since then, particularly as it stands relative to that of my coworkers from that period.<p>The best part was that the boss had borrowed the plastic fecal matter from a friend of his and had to go fish it out of the dumpster to avoid buying a new one.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2194746 href="vote?for=2194746&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2194746></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sudont">sudont</a> 361 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2194746">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Maybe it's just my millenial entitlement, but that strikes me as a bad strategy. Unless the business was a cleaning or maintenance company, cleaning the bathroom seems far removed from anything relevant to my work and is in essence busywork.

Will this be representative of my time at the company?<p>Pitching in when it needs to be cleaned? Sure. Boss paying attention to who voluntarily cleans it? Sure.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think the purpose of these kinds of litmus tests (to find people who are willing to get the job done, even if it looks stupid, boring, or detestable) is more important than filtering for independent thinkers.<p>Quite frankly, a good manager would be able to determine whether someone's a brownnoser or an independent thinker through other means.  Heck, just talking with people will be sufficient for managers who are experienced and talented.  But a litmus test like this reveals a lot about the nature of a person that can't come out in a conversation.  You see them talk the talk, now see them walk the walk; not in terms of their professional skills, but in terms of their human nature/personality/potential for leadership.<p>Because the thing is, this kind of litmus test has one other very positive goal.  See how someone responds to stupid orders.  It's a huge sign for how well they'd be able to handle conflict and politics, which exist in any organization, even startups.  It's the unfortunate nature of the beast, but good conflict management also does much to foster amazing outcomes, productivity, and creativity.<p>You want that kind of independent thinker over a guy who's a prima donna, even if he is an undisputed talent.  To think that litmus tests cause organizations to hire only brownnosers would say more about the quality of the managers than litmus tests themselves.<p>Don't hate the litmus test, hate the managers who don't have higher purposes.  We shouldn't be petty about that kind of stuff, it says a lot about our ability (or lack thereof) to handle human interaction well.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2194575 href="vote?for=2194575&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2194575></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jarek">jarek</a> 361 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2194575">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's Friday evening. You and your team will be at the office through the weekend to finish a release. The toilet backed up, spilling onto the bathroom floor. The building's cleaning staff will not be around until Monday, and there is no protocol for emergencies. Will you clean the bathroom?<p>What I have done is contrive a plausible scenario where cleaning the bathroom is something that just has to get done in order for you to fulfill your stated role as a software developer. I agree with edw519's point and that of the article author's: leaders get done what has to get done regardless of what it is. Sometimes that means crawling around on your hands and knees stringing along ethernet cords. Sometimes that means implementing boring but necessary infrastructure code. Sometimes that means cleaning the bathroom.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2195191 href="vote?for=2195191&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2195191></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jarek">jarek</a> 361 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2195191">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; Will you clean the bathroom?<p>Yes. (Though I better be getting paid overtime for that weekend work if the schedule slip isn't the dev team's fault.)<p>There is a large difference between cleaning a bathroom in an emergency on a Friday evening and cleaning a bathroom because the boss wants to test you on a Monday morning.<p>Are you assuming that just because someone cleaned it when their boss forced them to as condition of continued employment, they will step up and volunteer to do it in the future rather than try to pawn it off on someone else? Are you assuming the inverse is also true?<p>This has very little to do with leadership, by the way.<p>--<p>edit: If I come in for my first day on a Monday morning and the boss tells me that the team is scrambling to finish up a release, the toilet is backed up, and the cleaning staff won't be here until the evening, I'll look at him weird and maybe not think highly of his organizational skills, but I'd be much more likely to help than in the case of being asked to clean just to see if I am willing to put up with shit.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=320></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2197222 href="vote?for=2197222&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2197222></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=DougBTX">DougBTX</a> 360 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2197222">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"But their reason to hit the phones is to understand the business and its customers."<p>No it's not. If I'm a DB admin, I sure as _hell_ wouldn't be caught dead reading through a sizing chart for some chatty gal in Texas. No way.<p>At least that's the so-called "millenial" mentality, right?<p>Cleaning bathrooms is a task. You're hired by your employer to do a job, which involves many tasks I'm sure. You're not just a title holder or a problem domain solver. And, as long as you "have no concrete plans" to be your own boss, you'll _always_ be looked upon as an employee. I think you conflate your titles with "I do no other thing than that with which I am programmed". That's what we layfolk call a machine, not an employee.<p>But, if you prefer abject reductionism of the employee definition, you're a unit of work. That includes whatever the employer wants. Request in, results out; regardless of what the request is. I don't need you to understand my business; that's _my_ business. I just need you to work for me.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2195098 href="vote?for=2195098&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2195098></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jarek">jarek</a> 361 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2195098">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>While I appreciate being judged without being known as much as the next guy, no, you're wrong. (How's that for a millenial thing to say!)<p>I'm not sure where "I won't clean bathrooms on my first day as a software developer" turns into "I do <i>no other thing</i> than that with which I am programmed" (emphasis added). If you were a DB admin, would you think walking the owners' dog is beneficial for your career? Will <i>you</i> do <i>everything</i> an employer asks of you? If not, where do you draw the line, and why?<p>These actions have results. By making everyone hit the phones, you select against those not comfortable with talking to people they don't know on the phone. (Do I need to point out that you have no idea if they're socially incompetent, spoiled, or they don't like talking on the phone because of a hearing impediment?) By making people clean the bathrooms on their first day, you select against those who aren't interested in proving their willingness to get their hands dirty with busywork absolutely unrelated to their careers. That might be your intended goal. That is fine. Just realize what you're doing. I heard good employees are hard to find these days.<p>An employer is absolutely free to treat me as a machine to perform units of whatever work happens to be necessary. And I am absolutely free to not work for employers like that.<p>What <i>I</i> call a machine is someone who does whatever the management asks of them with no personal thoughts, concerns, or plans to speak of. <i>Someone</i> will have to understand your business, and unless you have no concrete plans to grow beyond a five-person shop, that will have to include someone other than the big boss.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2194976 href="vote?for=2194976&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2194976></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=deadmansshoes">deadmansshoes</a> 361 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2194976">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm curious about whether the business owner mentioned this during the hiring process.<p>I also wonder whether this affected the demographics of the company. If someone were to spring this on me on my first day of work, I'd probably wonder whether this was a hazing ritual or a test (and whether the desired behavior was to clean the bathroom myself or get it clean some other way). If, in addition to that, I happened to be the first female employee or the first employee with an ethnicity different from the owner's, I'd also wonder whether this was really something they did to everyone or whether it was some kind of racist/sexist stunt -- especially since this would be happening on my first day of work, before I had a chance to get to know anyone reasonably well.

I've lost track of the number of times I've witnessed mediocre employees become great with a change of management.<p>That person with great references and potential you hired didn't suddenly turn into a "six".  Something you or your organization did changed them.  On the other hand, that disgruntled, under-performing employee didn't suddenly become great when the new manager restructured his job and paid attention to him.<p>Like most stories, this one has two sides.

The developer that "makes it work", but writes code so labrythine and undocumented as to make it impossible for any other developer to succeed. Or the middle manager that will sabotage other projects inside the company in order to look good in comparison.<p>The easy question to answer is "should you hire good employees?". The hard question to answer is "how do you determine good vs bad?" Maybe those sixes aren't trying because they're worried that any exceptional performance will be seen as a threat to a paranoid senior staff member.<p>For every one true 10/10 employee there are five con-artists.

If I need inspiration, that'll either make me or break me.<p>One of these days, I'd like to make the claim that some incredible technology of the 21st century was conceived in an edifice borne out of the some of the best technology of the 19th century.<p>"My aspirations take a higher flight. Mine be it to have contributed to the enlightenment and the joys of the mind, to the things of the spirit, to all that tends to bring into the lives of the toilers of Pittsburgh sweetness and light. I hold this the noblest possible use of wealth." - Andrew Carnegie at the Dedication of Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, November 5, 1895.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2194308 href="vote?for=2194308&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2194308></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=adestefan">adestefan</a> 361 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2194308">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>It's bad for the business of programming because now customers expect to be able to find a free solution to every problem.</i><p>Here's the dirty little secret about B2B software:<p>It's not about the money.<p>It's about the risk.<p>I tell my customers that if they can find a free generic horizontal piece of software that provides them value without risk, then by all means, use it.<p>Then I ask them to consider questions like these:<p><pre><code>  - Is the website up?
  - Is the fulfillment system up?
  - Is the phone system up?
  - Did we get that order?
  - Did that order ship?
  - Did the customer pay?
  - Did the bank get the money?
  - Did the material get received?
  - Did we make payroll?
  - Did we get the best price?
  - Where are our revenues below plan?
  - Where are our margins below plan?
  - What are our numbers for the day? Week? Month? Quarter?
  </code></pre>
Then the killer question: "If we don't know the answer to any of the above because of our free software then who are you going to call?"<p>If you have a good answer to that question, then you may want to consider a free software alternative.  Otherwise, paying for legitimate software and support is simply the price of doing business.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>These are all great questions to ask about <i>any</i> software that powers a business. Of course, if you are "selling" software on the basis of the question "who are you going to call?", then you have to embrace the fact that you are not in the software business, you're in the "You can call me" business. You're really in the software support business.<p>Everything about your pricing model is really a kind of fiction. The charge up front, the license, everything. It's really a support business, pure and simple. Oracle and IBM know this, and so do their customers.<p>And thus the business proposition as a developer comes down to:<p>1. If I'm in the support business, writing and selling my own software places my customers in thrall to me. I have a monopoly on support. Of course, that means they have a certain risk since I'm the sole vendor.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You're absolutely right, but this is well covered ground when dealing with smaller software vendors in a B2B environment.  Source code escrow (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_escrow" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_escrow</a>) is something we would often do when I worked for a company that sold ERP software.  The basics of the idea are to give good answers to all the questions you put at the top of your post about what happens if the worst happens.  A source escrow agreement makes it so that if the company you're buying the software from disappears, you at least have access to the source and will have a shot at not being completely screwed.<p>Thing is, though, that the source code license isn't really the thing that you're betting on.  It's your relationship with the vendor.  Your business can be screwed a lot by a business long before the escrow agreement kicks in, and long before they fold.<p>Being heavily dependent on a software company, at least in ERP type business software, is a lot like marriage.  You definitely want to pick the right one, and it's all about the relationship.  If the marriage goes bad, it can make your life hellish, even if you do have a pre-nup.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2186291 href="vote?for=2186291&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2186291></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=etherealG">etherealG</a> 363 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2186291">link</a></span></div><br>

Take it or leave it.<p><i>What do you think about YAGNI?</i><p>Never gave it much thought before.  But after reading your referral, let me rephrase the question: "How do you know what you're going to need?"<p>After servicing hundreds of customers, I built a framework that provided what over 90% of had already needed.  I figured it was a pretty good bet most new customers would too.  So far it's worked out great.  The framework has easily replaced one or two other programmers.<p>But then again, that isn't even what the original question was about.  OP asked the #1 thing that made me a better programmer.  This was the #1 answer by far.  I think everyone should write a framework, whether you need one or not.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I believe that there are two ways to get good at anything, "push" and "pull".<p>Push: You learn from books, classes, mentors, and studying examples, then apply what you have learned.<p>Pull: You have a problem that you must solve, then you learn what you need, any way you can, to build the solution.<p>I suppose there are pros and cons of each method, and I imagine that many people here have used some of both.<p>For the record, I am 100% Pull.  I have absolutely no formal training.  It took me 2 years to find my first job and then I was thrown into the deep end.  It was simultaneously frustrating and exhilarating.  There were so many times I didn't know what to do or didn't have enough "tools" in my box.  So I had to figure it out and find sources of learning.  But I always did.  Any when I got that first thing working and then saw my customer's eyes light up, I was hooked.<p>Your CS degree may make you think that you're a "push" learner, but may I suggest that you adopt a "pull" approach.  Forget what you think you know and find a job or a project or someone who has a real need.  Then build what you need.  You a several advantages over me:  (a) It shouldn't take you long to find that job/demand/customer.  Just keep looking.  (b) You already have tools in your tool box, maybe not the right ones for the job, but you have <i>something</i>.  And (c) It's easier than ever to adopt a "pull" approach.  Help is everywhere.<p>You may feel frustrated, but I don't think you have a problem at all.  You're in a great (and very normal) situation.  Just adjust you attitude, find something to build, and do it.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2179484 href="vote?for=2179484&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2179484></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sophacles">sophacles</a> 365 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2179484">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The problem with pure pull is that you end up spending an inordinate amount of time reinventing the wheel, working towards one solution that you can see, while a much better and simpler solution is just around the corner because you don't have the breadth of knowledge to see past the sort of myopic view it provides.<p>On the other hand a pure push approach results in lack of practical knowledge, and frequently a "purity over pragmatism" mindset.  As a guy who works regularly with grad students, this is frustrating -- the 100th argument consisting of me saying "yes I know the theory your professor taught, but here is how you do it for real given the bugs in the library implementation (or the runtime constraints or whatever)" gets pretty old too.<p>I guess I'm saying a pure approach for either has a tendency to miss a pile of benefits, and introduces it's own drawbacks.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2179574 href="vote?for=2179574&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2179574></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=abrenzel">abrenzel</a> 365 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2179574">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Maybe the best thing to do is to try and sequence your "pushing" and "pulling."  I actually graduated with a Political Science degree in 2009.  I came to my first job not knowing a lick of programming, and the job didn't require it anyway.  I got into programming because we were trying to do a website redesign and I wanted to help out.  After we finished up that project, I kept going at because I liked it.<p>The first 9-12 months were tough.  I read some beginner's books, wrote lots of really ugly code, and got things to work eventually, if only barely.<p>Then the code started to get prettier and more robust, and I picked up some more theoretical books like Leiserson's Intro to Algorithms to learn the theory.  Having "pulled" around code for 9-12 months on my own, learning more formal computer science really allowed me to begin gluing those pieces together.<p>Everyone learns differently.  Maybe a better approach for some CS programs would be to throw students into the water for their first year, let them struggle reinventing the wheel and solving practical problems as best they can, and then teach the theory and formalisms later?</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2181476 href="vote?for=2181476&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2181476></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=narrator">narrator</a> 365 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2181476">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's funny, I used to be a pull person. I learned by doing. It worked great.<p>But at some point, I picked up a book because of a recommendation and it was astonishingly good (Cocoa Programming on OSX, Hillegaas). It gave me a real sense of confidence and overview that I was lacking in all my pull-learned topics. I guess this is because pull only ever provides very localized knowledge but you rarely see the big picture.<p>Since then, I tend to push-learn at first to get a feeling and overview over a language or framework and then gradually switch over to a more pull-oriented approach. This has served me very well. Some books out there are real marvels that can get you started with a new technology very painlessly. Gathering all that knowledge would take a lot longer.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I take a "pull" approach myself, and you're absolutely right about him being in a good situation. A CS degree with no experience is more likely to get an ordinary programming job than a self-taught freelancer with 4 years experience under his belt - in my experience.<p>I just wanted to expand on the "find a job or project or someone who has a real need." This part was tricky for me. I love learning, and my approach for a long time was to just keep learning rather than doing. As soon as I would finish one programming book or tutorial series I'd start on another. If I ran across something new and interesting I would switch over to it. After a long time approach to doing that I realized I had a lot of half-baked knowledge and nothing to show for it.<p>Finally I buckled down and "did." I started by tackling a problem of my own - keeping focused, on task, and efficient. It has become a tangible project that I will (soon) be able to show a potential employer or even make money off of it. The best part is that it's something I personally believe in and need, so I'm passionate about it. Working on someone else's project sometimes makes it hard to get excited about what you're creating.<p>If you can't think of some problem of your own to solve, work on someone else's. The best approach I know of here is to find a local not-for-profit organization or charity. Ask them what could improve their ability to do whatever it is they do, or even help save them money and then create it. Give it to them free of charge. This a) gives you something tangible to show potential employers, b) could possibly be a tax write off, c) gives you real world "pull" experience, d) is for a good cause.<p>Some people might tell you that you should never do work for free. In this case, the work you're doing <i>is benefiting you</i>, even if there is no money involved. Besides, if it's for a good cause then there will be rewards - assuming you believe in God or karma :)<p>To reiterate edw519, adjust your attitude, find something to build, and do it.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2179354 href="vote?for=2179354&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2179354></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kleinsch">kleinsch</a> 365 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2179354">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I did a lot of Push learning in college and shortly afterward. I'd buy a bunch of books, read them cover to cover, and look up stuff on the web. I found that it was a good way to get familiar with certain topics, so I knew which tools to use for certain types of problems. The problem I found is that I'd spend lots of time reading about something that was less applicable, and the minute I got into a non-trivial application, I'd have to spend hours looking up details that I hadn't covered. I spent a bunch of time doing Push, but then had to also do an equal amount of Pull when I tried to use it.<p>I've since changed my approach. I limit my Push to little bits in order to familiarize myself with tools, but don't go too far in detail. This way I can cover a wider range of topics without wasting time on details I'll never use. Then when I actually start a project, I'll dive into the details as I'm using them. I find digging into details after you have context for what you're doing also helps with memory.<p>I think the OP probably learned more than they think they did, they just need some context to string it all together and help jog their memory. I wish I'd figured this out in college or shortly afterward, because most of what I learned was "in one ear, out the other".</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2180808 href="vote?for=2180808&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2180808></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ohyes">ohyes</a> 365 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2180808">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I don't think that there is really this distinction, because your 'push' and 'pull' methods allow you to acquire different types of expertise/knowledge.<p>If you are all push, you won't be able to program.
If you are really all pull, you will be able to program, but it will be kind of magical programming.<p>Ex. If I am all pull: I know that the regular expression matches based on certain rules, but I don't understand complexity theory or finite automata, so I don't understand that I shouldn't use a regex to process xml. I might create a working program, but it is likely that it will be convoluted and take me longer (or be buggy in ways which I cannot comprehend!), because I reinvented solutions to already solved problems, or didn't understand the tools I was using.<p>If I am all push, programming becomes an intimidating experience. For obvious reasons, I'm going to have difficulty problem solving, obviously -- I've never actually sat down and solved problems. It would be like trying to learn math without having done any practice exercises.<p>I started as a 100% pull programmer (with minimal formal CS training), and have been pushing through a masters degree in CS. It has helped me by bounds. The concepts themselves are important, but also important is understanding the approach to problem solving that led to the concept. I can apply the theories behind a compiler or database (or anything) in places where a compiler or database would be totally inappropriate.<p>Point being, I see things differently now.<p>There are a lot more options for me to look into when I'm initially researching how to solve a problem, and it is a lot less likely to be influenced by whatever the new hotness buzzwords happen to be for the season, and because of that, my results are much better.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2186339 href="vote?for=2186339&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2186339></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bothor">bothor</a> 363 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2186339">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You bring up an interesting point - I was a "pull" programmer up until I went to university and took a Java course. I learnt there object oriented programming, and suddenly everything I had learnt previously "clicked" and I saw the big picture, and I'm a much better programmer for it.<p>You could make a comparison to music. The self-taught guitarist versus the classically trained guitarist, and the guitarist somewhere in between. When I took guitar lessons I wasn't taught classically, but I was taught the concepts (the theory behind chords, scales, etc.) and I was also encouraged to pick things up on my own by both playing around and finding tabs for my favourite songs and having a go.<p>This push vs pull concept can probably be applied to ways of learning in general.

It wasn't in college study things, I was there to learn how to do things.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2180408 href="vote?for=2180408&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2180408></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=scott_s">scott_s</a> 365 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2180408">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think it's a question of the kind of code that people do in science/engineering as compared to CS (my background is that I'm a practicing physicist, but started out with a background in Computer Engineering in undergrad.)
Yes, some basic CS (say an algorithms class) would be useful--but much of what we're working on as physicists is not what a traditional CS program would emphasize.  For example, you have people with relatively small data sets that they want to fit--learning a language is about as far as they need to go.  Others end up wanting to put a user interface around it if they use it excessively or distribute it for others.  While perhaps a course on UI would be of use, for most, it's not what excites us, or advances us in our field.<p>Now, there are some who are doing high performance computing where abstraction and software engineering become important--but again, at the undergraduate level, how many courses are emphasizing the advantages of say templated C++ programming for scientific computations?<p>I think a service course on scientific computing would be of more use to most physicists than a general background in CS.  For those that will end up working on large projects, then perhaps a course on software engineering. As for math courses, maybe I was a bit weird, but didn't you learn diff. equations in high school :p?  But as for things like PDEs and such--I will say that a lot of it is learned as part of the coursework for say a first modern physics course, rather than in a math course...<p>For us, math, programming, etc. are tools that we use to do what we're interested in...(This is in no way to denigrate math or programming)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2182031 href="vote?for=2182031&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2182031></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=RK">RK</a> 364 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2182031">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>As a physics undergrad we were told "you should probably learn a programming language", but were never given any specific course requirements (or suggestions that I remember).<p>I actually took multiple programming classes and ended up doing my PhD in computational physics. One of the biggest issues is that much of the software written by and for physicists tends to have very poor design, because they tend to learn the bare minimum necessary to get things to work (in Fortran no less).<p><i>They still insisted you take math courses, correct?</i><p>This is true, but we still learned a ton of math techniques in our physics classes.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The head of the program was a cosmologist, actually. I know that she taught herself to code, as did the other two profs I worked for. -I think that had something to do with their attitudes. Also, it might have just been from a practicality standpoint. We didn't have the room for multiple CS courses, and the students seemed to be able to pick it up well enough to do what they needed to.<p>I have to mention, I did take a 100-level CS course as an elective, and personally, it was too basic. I think to get what we needed, we would have had to skip the intro courses, and I it's possible the CS department would have frowned on that. On a related note, my PhD was in medical physics, and our department did have an agreement with the bio department to let us take a 400 level physiology class without the prereqs. It was a point-of-pride in the physics program that our students always lead those classes.<p>No doubt CS can get deep and anyone that codes could benefit from those higher-level courses. But, I think the situation wouldn't allow for that.<p>Maybe she was saying that physics students were bright enough to figure out what they needed on their own. From what I saw, she would be correct there. We weren't <i>math</i> majors, but we were pretty able. :)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2180791 href="vote?for=2180791&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%36%51%63%73%37%79%32%76%46"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2180791></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=scott_s">scott_s</a> 365 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2180791">link</a></span></div><br>
