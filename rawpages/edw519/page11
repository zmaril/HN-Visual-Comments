<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I could have written the bit about my grandfather.<p>He passed away 36 years ago this week and I was already thinking about him quite a bit.<p>He was the most amazing person I ever met.  He came to the U.S. alone when he was 11 years old and lived with strangers until he met my grandmother at a picnic.  They were married 3 weeks later.  He spoke 5 languages fluently, played 6 musical instruments, never went to school a single day in his life, and he could fix anything.<p>Like OP, one of my most favorite days of my childhood was when I was 12 and my grandfather took me to work with him.  I remember helping him carry his tools down the back steps and load them into the trunk of his Ford Galaxie 500.  He taught me my all time favorite cuss word when he said, "Move all that shitcrap out of the way."<p>Just the other day, I drove right past that spot, stopped, and sat for a while, remembering the good old days.  Today, just like OP, I just call someone to get something fixed.  I've almost forgotten the joy of getting things done with my hands with the gentle guidance of a master.<p>Thanks for the memories, Mike Rowe and goldins.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2544630 href="vote?for=2544630&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%49%49%59%4e%44%33%69%6b%52%66"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2544630></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=AlexMuir">AlexMuir</a> 267 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2544630">link</a></span></div><br>

And people are having to learn them RIGHT NOW, because they can't afford to call someone out to change their fuse / fix their washer.  If you aren't working, you've got time to fiddle around for a while and get something fixed.  Do it a few times and you start to get good at it and more confident.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Actually, sending the least experienced technician to your house first is an intentional tactic. My father is a retired HVAC person of more than 40 years. He used to work for small family owned shops but the big companies (like gas companies) began buying up the shops in various areas. Then providing HVAC service plans via your gas bills.<p>They would load up on young guys and keep one or two old guys. They'd always send the young guys first because they were paid about 1/5th of the amount of the old guys per hour. If they fixed things correctly, then they made more profit. If they didn't fix things, you still paid the hourly rate anyway. After the revolving technicians of various skills attempted to fix (and charge you anyway), they would eventually send in the senior guy to actually perform the repair.<p>Most of the repairs are easy and minor. Nowadays furnaces have circuit boards with LED lights indicating the problem. So it's mostly just replacement of a known part. So most of the time they made a lot of profit by sending the youngest/cheapest guys.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2545348 href="vote?for=2545348&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%49%49%59%4e%44%33%69%6b%52%66"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2545348></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=HeyLaughingBoy">HeyLaughingBoy</a> 267 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2545348">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This brings up an interesting side point. I'm not sure if it's the same everywhere, but in the state I reside there are two sides to the trade professions.<p>One side is the service side. This is typically non-union and employees are trained at vocational schools that specialize in some field of expertise.<p>The other side is the new construction side. This is typically union and employees are trained via schooling and apprenticeships provided by the union itself.<p>In general, the union/new construction side makes more money, but, it's harder to get into the union and you generally work less hours (and make less money) until you are a fairly senior person. The non-union/service side will make more money (and work more hours) at least initially. The service side has very high turnover of youngsters.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2544984 href="vote?for=2544984&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%49%49%59%4e%44%33%69%6b%52%66"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2544984></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=hnal943">hnal943</a> 267 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2544984">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000> Some people seem to be born troubleshooters they seem to be able to just know how to fix any problem especially obscure problems.<p>For example your car is acting up and the troubleshooter knows it's the fifth contact on a relay since it's the old original model 5b relay which he can tell from the sound of the clicking and he knows the fifth contact tends to corrode on the left side each spring when the humidity is higher. Give it a whack and a spray of contact cleaner and tells you to park it in the sun for an hour. Good as new.<p>The normal way is taking 20 or 30 years to know about a trade or just life in general and just seeing it so much you become a bit like the born troubleshooter but you'll never be as good.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2549101 href="vote?for=2549101&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%49%49%59%4e%44%33%69%6b%52%66"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2549101></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=fleitz">fleitz</a> 265 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2549101">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>class sizes are increasing</i><p>You seem to be perpetuating the idea that class size determines educational quality, and it ain't true. Indeed, it seems that many people take class size as a proxy for the quality. But it's false.<p>If you go looking for actual data on the relationship between size and educational achievement, you'll find that it's pretty inconclusive. Nobody has been able to show a strong correlation linking smaller classes with better learning. The one exception is a study showing that in the specific population of "at-risk kids" (meaning, those who are probably not getting educational support at home), having smaller classes does help. But for the mainstream, nobody has been able to prove that investing in more teachers to shrink the size of classes has any positive impact.<p>Continuing to harp on class size is part of the problem. It wastes money, preventing it from being employed in areas where it could do real good.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=360></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2549164 href="vote?for=2549164&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%49%49%59%4e%44%33%69%6b%52%66"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2549164></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nitrogen">nitrogen</a> 265 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2549164">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I respectfully believe you are grossly misinformed.  Do you know any teachers personally?  It varies across the country, but local teachers are paid half the salary of managers and software developers after receiving the same amount of education, yet they're expected to spend every waking hour dealing with students.  Here are some concrete numbers for a junior high teacher:<p>7 classes per term, average of 40 students per class = 280 students total.  There are 7 classes per day of 45 minutes each, with 5 minutes between classes and a 30 minute lunch.  Teachers have to meet with students before and/or after school and monitor students between classes, so they're typically at school and busy for 8 hours or more per day with no breaks except <i>maybe</i> lunch.  You try locking yourself in a building with 1000 or more shouting young teenagers for 8 hours straight without so much as a bathroom break.<p>If a teacher assigns a homework assignment every day and spends three hours per day (at home) grading assignments, then <i>each student gets less than one minute of attention per assignment</i>.  Every student has his or her own points of confusion on the subject matter, which cannot be addressed in just one minute per day, and using class time to broadly address the questions of a few students slows down the students who don't have the same questions.<p>Notice I didn't include any time for designing lesson plans and presentations, writing grant proposals, creating assignments, or meeting with parents, let alone spending time with their families (which often enough just doesn't happen).<p>Regarding "furniture problems:" desks are a fixed size, they have to be spaced apart enough for students and teachers to reach them without tripping, and the classroom also needs presentation space at the front, a teacher's desk, and storage space.  Fire codes specify maximum occupancy limits for rooms.  There's only so much room available for desks.<p>Maybe you have to see the combined exasperation and exhaustion of an overworked and underpaid teacher to appreciate the level of decay present in our public school systems.  This is an area where averages and statistics are misleading.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2545414 href="vote?for=2545414&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%49%49%59%4e%44%33%69%6b%52%66"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2545414></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=anamax">anamax</a> 267 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2545414">link</a></span></div><br>

It's not the teachers, they keep getting cut. 
It's not the administrators, there aren't that many of them, and they've been cutting right along with the teachers. And the administrative load doesn't get smaller, since there are an ever multiplying number of federal compliance issues. 
It's not maintenance, as they don't have the resources they need to keep the aging infrastructure going. They could double their staff for a year and still not get through stuff. 
It's not transportation, they're getting hit by fuel costs. 
It's not the secretaries, they're getting hit too. 
The text books, meh, most of them are pretty old. 
Maybe it's technology, but that's a separate levy and a different pool of money.<p>We've got old buildings, one should have been closed years ago. That could save a teacher or two per year, but there's community pressure to keep it open.<p>Frankly, we spend less on education here per student per year than I would spend to send a kid to daycare for the same time.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's not so much that I disagree with OP, it's just that I've never done much of what he recommends.<p><i>Initially, screw the algorithms and data structures.</i><p>That's like saying, "Initially, screw the basement and build the attic."  The number one problem I've ever seen with shitty code, over and over and over again, is lack of understanding of fundamentals.  Do yourself a favor and learn how to build things properly first.  Poorly structured data cannot be overcome by the greatest of processes.  Poorly structured processes will give you technical debt forever.<p><i>Choose a good language. One that you think you can produce something useful in short time.</i><p>This is a chicken and egg problem.  How would anyone know which language to choose without using it first?  Choose <i>anything</i>, just get to work.  (When in doubt, choose something popular.  Things will be tough enough without running into problems no one has ever seen before.)<p><i>Choose a good editor.</i><p>No.  The more features and functions an editor or EDI has, the more crutches you'll routinely use when you don't need them.  Which means you won't learn and grow as quickly.  Choose something simple like Textpad, disable the syntax color highlighting, and make mistakes.  Sure, it'll be a pain in the ass, but that's the best way to learn the quickest.<p><i>Use an operating system that’ll teach you something.</i><p>If you are paying enough attention to the operating system to know what it is, then you aren't paying enough attention to what you're building.  Focus on what you're building.  Get it to work properly on any operating system.  Let someone else worry about porting or emulating on other operating systems later.<p><i>Don’t copy-paste files to backup stuff.</i><p>I've been doing this for 30 years and have never lost anything.  I save every old version.  Relying on special software to do this for you makes you dependent on that software so much so that you may lose track in your head of what you have.  Other programmers may disagree with me; it just shows that there is more than one way to do things.<p><i>Know where to get help.</i><p>The more popular your choices are, the easier it is to do this.  (Don't make the same mistake as me: using specialty and proprietary technologies.  When Technology A and Technology B don't play nicely together, it's really hard to find someone else who has experienced the same problem.)<p><i>Develop your netiquette.</i><p>"netiquette" shouldn't be any different from any other etiquette.  Just treat others the way you'd like to be treated.<p><i>Meet people, because books only teach you routine stuff (oh and the "book" is dead they say).</i><p>People aren't much better than books.  The best teacher is building stuff.<p><i>Write opensource code.</i><p>I've never done this and have never understood why people think it's so important.  I prefer to build stuff for paying customers.  They're never bashful and are a great way to get really good really quickly.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2528538 href="vote?for=2528538&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%49%49%59%4e%44%33%69%6b%52%66"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2528538></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=NickPollard">NickPollard</a> 271 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2528538">link</a></span></div><br>

This is far more important than being up-to-date with language X or framework Y.<p>However (and this is a big however), the letter is targeted  at people who are thinking about learning to program, in which case it's important for them to actually achieve something quickly, so that they will be encouraged to continue.<p>When I started to program (at the grand age of 3), I wrote absolutely terrible programs in BBC-Basic. For years I wrote lines and lines of code without a single function, procedure or subroutine. Even Arrays, lists and such were beyond me.<p>I didn't care though. I had written stuff that worked. I had created text based adventure games that the computer would play with me. To a young kid, that feeling of power, creativity and success was like a drug, and I was addicted.<p>If instead, I'd spent ages reading books to work out whether I should be using quicksort or radixsort, or whether my Hashmap would scale well enough, I'd have gotten bored and never written anything, and probably become an accountant.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2528742 href="vote?for=2528742&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%49%49%59%4e%44%33%69%6b%52%66"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2528742></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=oinksoft">oinksoft</a> 271 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2528742">link</a></span></div><br>

This is not endurance training with sand bags on the ankles, and there is no real long-term benefit of having a syntax-unaware editor. I'd instead recommend using an editor with basic support for many file types, like vim, emacs, or TextMate (or something like notepad++ for windows, which I can't comment on) to eliminate as much as possible the chilling effect on picking up something new, caused by "uh oh, my editor has no clue what this is."</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2528715 href="vote?for=2528715&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%49%49%59%4e%44%33%69%6b%52%66"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2528715></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=SingAlong">SingAlong</a> 271 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2528715">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thanks everyone for the comments on the blog post. I don't know how whoever submitted this found this one. This started as a letter to my junior in college who asked me for advice on where to start.<p><i>The number one problem I've ever seen with shitty code, over and over and over again, is lack of understanding of fundamentals.</i><p>I humbly beg to differ and would stick to my words - <i>"Initially, screwing the algorithms and data structures"</i>. I guess I should have written the word "initially" in all-caps.<p>I feel that to be creative as a programmer, it's very essential that you can fuel your creative self by motivation. And that can happen not by reading too much about how to do it, but instead just jumping into the pool and checking it out (which a you, me and a lot others agree on). Later on, when interested to improve, the theory part can be learnt. The intention was not to scare away those who want to begin by telling them there's a learning curve to be followed and instead just say "here's what you can do, check these out, install these stuff and get started".<p><i>How would anyone know which language to choose without using it first?</i><p>Which is why I mentioned trying out some languages for a few hours and choosing something of personal taste + something with good docs (getting started, tutorials, etc).<p>About backing up files by copy-paste, IMO, it's just personal choice. Whatever works for you. Since the post was targeted at someone who wanted to begin, I thought I should clearly mention to the reader that better tools existed.<p><i>I prefer to build stuff for paying customers.</i><p>Atleast to get to that point where you 'can' build stuff for paying customers, you have to start somewhere. First, finding paying customers isn't that easy for everyone. Second, when you don't know programming at all, and are trying to deliver something technical to a paying customer, IMO, it's just building castles in the air.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2528769 href="vote?for=2528769&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%49%49%59%4e%44%33%69%6b%52%66"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2528769></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=fr0sty">fr0sty</a> 271 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2528769">link</a></span></div><br>

If you're established and have people who <i>want</i> to pay you money, sticking to paying customers makes sense. But do you really think that applies to people who are new? I mean, who in their right mind would want to pay Joe Justlearnedpython to build their stuff? From what I hear, even many people who actually know what they're doing but haven't had their name "out there" have a hard time finding paying work.<p>(I can't speak from experience. I'm not primarily a freelancer, and I pretty much only do it when somebody I know comes up to me and says, "Hey, I need X. Can you provide it?"

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This is a nice start, but after reading "Pillar #1 - Technical Competence", this sounds more like a guide for systems administrators than for developers.<p>Don't get me wrong, everything in Pillar #1 is important, but I think there are much more important things for an aspiring developer to consider.<p>Just off the top of my head:<p><pre><code>  - program structure and organization
  - variable typing, naming, &#38; use
  - function/subroutine strategy &#38; use
  - frameworks &#38; APIs
  - algorithms
  - database design, structure, &#38; access
  - benchmarking
  - performance tuning
  - scaling
  - security
  - testing philosophy and strategies
  - systems analysis
  - systems design
  - prototyping
  </code></pre>
To better understand the difference between a software developer and a systems administrator, I often use this analogy:<p>My users/customers are race car drivers.  We developers build and maintain their cars.  Systems administrator build and maintain the racetrack itself.  Every link in the chain is necessary, but in my experience, smooth pavement with poorly running cars is the norm.  So we developers need to focus more on building better software and leave as much admin as possible to those experts.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2518833 href="vote?for=2518833&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%49%49%59%4e%44%33%69%6b%52%66"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2518833></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=canterburry">canterburry</a> 275 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2518833">link</a></span></div><br>

There are plenty of places that aren't Google or Facebook that are software technology companies: where managers are technical, where engineers are judged on their technical skills and application thereof. Of course, non-technical skills matter everywhere and generally the larger the company is, the more important self-promotion and politics become. Yet if you're good (not just great), you should be able to find a place where management is technical and your technical skills are an asset: if you haven't, keep studying the fundamentals (interviews heavily focus on Computer Science) and take an active role in your industry (open source, etc...): connections you make, that can vouch for quality of your code <i>will</i> be able to make references that actually get you in the door.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2519260 href="vote?for=2519260&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%49%49%59%4e%44%33%69%6b%52%66"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2519260></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dasil003">dasil003</a> 275 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2519260">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>How you measure...</i><p>Simple answer:<p>I guess my original post was a long round-about way of saying:<p>Bad measure: "Do I feel like a had a good day?"<p>Better measure: "Do I feel like I got a lot done today?"<p>Best measure: "Do I have more valuable stuff built now than I did this morning?"<p>Sometimes we should just use the simplest measure and leave it at that.<p><i>how many hours-per-person-per-year of work I've saved other people</i><p>Oddly, in my experience, this is a poor metric.  Example: I wrote a sophisticated workbench to make inventory planners much more efficient.  And they were.  All 8 of them.  Then I made a 5 minute change to enable factory supervisors sort their dispatch list 8 different ways.  Which helped 800 people become more efficient.  That's why I don't even try to measure "value" anymore.  I let the customer worry about that.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Productivity isn't necessarily the wrong term here.  In the context of individual productivity, your Input is always going to be a unit (say, a day) of your time.  While you can split your time between a number of different tasks, your overall productivity still has 'one day' in the denominator (at least until cryogenic freezing is an option).  Second, Output doesn't need to be measured in lines of code, it can be Value.  The way you have written 'Value Delta' as a difference of two Values measured one day apart you have obscured the fact that time is in the denominator.  The interesting quantity for a given interval is (Value Delta) / (Time Delta), which can reasonably be called efficiency or productivity.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2515146 href="vote?for=2515146&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%49%49%59%4e%44%33%69%6b%52%66"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2515146></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=hammock">hammock</a> 276 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2515146">link</a></span></div><br>
