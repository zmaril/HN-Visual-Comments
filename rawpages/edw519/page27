<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I believe that there are two ways to get good at anything, "push" and "pull".<p>Push: You learn from books, classes, mentors, and studying examples, then apply what you have learned.<p>Pull: You have a problem that you must solve, then you learn what you need, any way you can, to build the solution.<p>I suppose there are pros and cons of each method, and I imagine that many people here have used some of both.<p>For the record, I am 100% Pull.  I have absolutely no formal training.  It took me 2 years to find my first job and then I was thrown into the deep end.  It was simultaneously frustrating and exhilarating.  There were so many times I didn't know what to do or didn't have enough "tools" in my box.  So I had to figure it out and find sources of learning.  But I always did.  Any when I got that first thing working and then saw my customer's eyes light up, I was hooked.<p>Your CS degree may make you think that you're a "push" learner, but may I suggest that you adopt a "pull" approach.  Forget what you think you know and find a job or a project or someone who has a real need.  Then build what you need.  You a several advantages over me:  (a) It shouldn't take you long to find that job/demand/customer.  Just keep looking.  (b) You already have tools in your tool box, maybe not the right ones for the job, but you have <i>something</i>.  And (c) It's easier than ever to adopt a "pull" approach.  Help is everywhere.<p>You may feel frustrated, but I don't think you have a problem at all.  You're in a great (and very normal) situation.  Just adjust you attitude, find something to build, and do it.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2179484 href="vote?for=2179484&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%73%5a%32%65%62%73%52%79%68"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2179484></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sophacles">sophacles</a> 366 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2179484">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The problem with pure pull is that you end up spending an inordinate amount of time reinventing the wheel, working towards one solution that you can see, while a much better and simpler solution is just around the corner because you don't have the breadth of knowledge to see past the sort of myopic view it provides.<p>On the other hand a pure push approach results in lack of practical knowledge, and frequently a "purity over pragmatism" mindset.  As a guy who works regularly with grad students, this is frustrating -- the 100th argument consisting of me saying "yes I know the theory your professor taught, but here is how you do it for real given the bugs in the library implementation (or the runtime constraints or whatever)" gets pretty old too.<p>I guess I'm saying a pure approach for either has a tendency to miss a pile of benefits, and introduces it's own drawbacks.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2179574 href="vote?for=2179574&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%73%5a%32%65%62%73%52%79%68"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2179574></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=abrenzel">abrenzel</a> 366 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2179574">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Maybe the best thing to do is to try and sequence your "pushing" and "pulling."  I actually graduated with a Political Science degree in 2009.  I came to my first job not knowing a lick of programming, and the job didn't require it anyway.  I got into programming because we were trying to do a website redesign and I wanted to help out.  After we finished up that project, I kept going at because I liked it.<p>The first 9-12 months were tough.  I read some beginner's books, wrote lots of really ugly code, and got things to work eventually, if only barely.<p>Then the code started to get prettier and more robust, and I picked up some more theoretical books like Leiserson's Intro to Algorithms to learn the theory.  Having "pulled" around code for 9-12 months on my own, learning more formal computer science really allowed me to begin gluing those pieces together.<p>Everyone learns differently.  Maybe a better approach for some CS programs would be to throw students into the water for their first year, let them struggle reinventing the wheel and solving practical problems as best they can, and then teach the theory and formalisms later?</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2181476 href="vote?for=2181476&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%73%5a%32%65%62%73%52%79%68"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2181476></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=narrator">narrator</a> 366 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2181476">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I've taught computer science and I've seen that one's brain either understands computing concepts, or it doesn't.  I've seen people with no programming experience pick it up pretty quickly.  I've also seen people who were otherwise smart not get anywhere at all. If people can get past assignment, indirection, and boolean logic, they'll probably do fine.  Understanding concurrency is also a sort of fundamental brain ability, but is something that fewer people have the ability for and is not necessary for every programming task.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2182628 href="vote?for=2182628&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%73%5a%32%65%62%73%52%79%68"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2182628></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=itsnotvalid">itsnotvalid</a> 365 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2182628">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's funny, I used to be a pull person. I learned by doing. It worked great.<p>But at some point, I picked up a book because of a recommendation and it was astonishingly good (Cocoa Programming on OSX, Hillegaas). It gave me a real sense of confidence and overview that I was lacking in all my pull-learned topics. I guess this is because pull only ever provides very localized knowledge but you rarely see the big picture.<p>Since then, I tend to push-learn at first to get a feeling and overview over a language or framework and then gradually switch over to a more pull-oriented approach. This has served me very well. Some books out there are real marvels that can get you started with a new technology very painlessly. Gathering all that knowledge would take a lot longer.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Interesting way to think about it. I found it funny because I've been working on ray tracing algorithms lately and it reminds me of that situation: They're both some form of optimization problems where you need to connect knowledge/light sources to problems/observers. Tracing from the knowledge/light source end is not efficient because you have no idea what will turn out to be important in the end, but tracing from the problem/observer end is also not efficient because in the end you have to connect your problem/observer to some knowledge/light source otherwise the entire path turned out to be futile.<p>Some form of bidirectional or multi-pass algorithm is likely to be more efficient here... ;-)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2179380 href="vote?for=2179380&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%73%5a%32%65%62%73%52%79%68"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2179380></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=matthiaswh">matthiaswh</a> 366 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2179380">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I take a "pull" approach myself, and you're absolutely right about him being in a good situation. A CS degree with no experience is more likely to get an ordinary programming job than a self-taught freelancer with 4 years experience under his belt - in my experience.<p>I just wanted to expand on the "find a job or project or someone who has a real need." This part was tricky for me. I love learning, and my approach for a long time was to just keep learning rather than doing. As soon as I would finish one programming book or tutorial series I'd start on another. If I ran across something new and interesting I would switch over to it. After a long time approach to doing that I realized I had a lot of half-baked knowledge and nothing to show for it.<p>Finally I buckled down and "did." I started by tackling a problem of my own - keeping focused, on task, and efficient. It has become a tangible project that I will (soon) be able to show a potential employer or even make money off of it. The best part is that it's something I personally believe in and need, so I'm passionate about it. Working on someone else's project sometimes makes it hard to get excited about what you're creating.<p>If you can't think of some problem of your own to solve, work on someone else's. The best approach I know of here is to find a local not-for-profit organization or charity. Ask them what could improve their ability to do whatever it is they do, or even help save them money and then create it. Give it to them free of charge. This a) gives you something tangible to show potential employers, b) could possibly be a tax write off, c) gives you real world "pull" experience, d) is for a good cause.<p>Some people might tell you that you should never do work for free. In this case, the work you're doing <i>is benefiting you</i>, even if there is no money involved. Besides, if it's for a good cause then there will be rewards - assuming you believe in God or karma :)<p>To reiterate edw519, adjust your attitude, find something to build, and do it.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2179354 href="vote?for=2179354&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%73%5a%32%65%62%73%52%79%68"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2179354></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kleinsch">kleinsch</a> 366 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2179354">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I did a lot of Push learning in college and shortly afterward. I'd buy a bunch of books, read them cover to cover, and look up stuff on the web. I found that it was a good way to get familiar with certain topics, so I knew which tools to use for certain types of problems. The problem I found is that I'd spend lots of time reading about something that was less applicable, and the minute I got into a non-trivial application, I'd have to spend hours looking up details that I hadn't covered. I spent a bunch of time doing Push, but then had to also do an equal amount of Pull when I tried to use it.<p>I've since changed my approach. I limit my Push to little bits in order to familiarize myself with tools, but don't go too far in detail. This way I can cover a wider range of topics without wasting time on details I'll never use. Then when I actually start a project, I'll dive into the details as I'm using them. I find digging into details after you have context for what you're doing also helps with memory.<p>I think the OP probably learned more than they think they did, they just need some context to string it all together and help jog their memory. I wish I'd figured this out in college or shortly afterward, because most of what I learned was "in one ear, out the other".</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2180808 href="vote?for=2180808&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%73%5a%32%65%62%73%52%79%68"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2180808></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ohyes">ohyes</a> 366 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2180808">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I don't think that there is really this distinction, because your 'push' and 'pull' methods allow you to acquire different types of expertise/knowledge.<p>If you are all push, you won't be able to program.
If you are really all pull, you will be able to program, but it will be kind of magical programming.<p>Ex. If I am all pull: I know that the regular expression matches based on certain rules, but I don't understand complexity theory or finite automata, so I don't understand that I shouldn't use a regex to process xml. I might create a working program, but it is likely that it will be convoluted and take me longer (or be buggy in ways which I cannot comprehend!), because I reinvented solutions to already solved problems, or didn't understand the tools I was using.<p>If I am all push, programming becomes an intimidating experience. For obvious reasons, I'm going to have difficulty problem solving, obviously -- I've never actually sat down and solved problems. It would be like trying to learn math without having done any practice exercises.<p>I started as a 100% pull programmer (with minimal formal CS training), and have been pushing through a masters degree in CS. It has helped me by bounds. The concepts themselves are important, but also important is understanding the approach to problem solving that led to the concept. I can apply the theories behind a compiler or database (or anything) in places where a compiler or database would be totally inappropriate.<p>Point being, I see things differently now.<p>There are a lot more options for me to look into when I'm initially researching how to solve a problem, and it is a lot less likely to be influenced by whatever the new hotness buzzwords happen to be for the season, and because of that, my results are much better.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2186339 href="vote?for=2186339&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%73%5a%32%65%62%73%52%79%68"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2186339></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bothor">bothor</a> 364 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2186339">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You bring up an interesting point - I was a "pull" programmer up until I went to university and took a Java course. I learnt there object oriented programming, and suddenly everything I had learnt previously "clicked" and I saw the big picture, and I'm a much better programmer for it.<p>You could make a comparison to music. The self-taught guitarist versus the classically trained guitarist, and the guitarist somewhere in between. When I took guitar lessons I wasn't taught classically, but I was taught the concepts (the theory behind chords, scales, etc.) and I was also encouraged to pick things up on my own by both playing around and finding tabs for my favourite songs and having a go.<p>This push vs pull concept can probably be applied to ways of learning in general.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think it's a question of the kind of code that people do in science/engineering as compared to CS (my background is that I'm a practicing physicist, but started out with a background in Computer Engineering in undergrad.)
Yes, some basic CS (say an algorithms class) would be useful--but much of what we're working on as physicists is not what a traditional CS program would emphasize.  For example, you have people with relatively small data sets that they want to fit--learning a language is about as far as they need to go.  Others end up wanting to put a user interface around it if they use it excessively or distribute it for others.  While perhaps a course on UI would be of use, for most, it's not what excites us, or advances us in our field.<p>Now, there are some who are doing high performance computing where abstraction and software engineering become important--but again, at the undergraduate level, how many courses are emphasizing the advantages of say templated C++ programming for scientific computations?<p>I think a service course on scientific computing would be of more use to most physicists than a general background in CS.  For those that will end up working on large projects, then perhaps a course on software engineering. As for math courses, maybe I was a bit weird, but didn't you learn diff. equations in high school :p?  But as for things like PDEs and such--I will say that a lot of it is learned as part of the coursework for say a first modern physics course, rather than in a math course...<p>For us, math, programming, etc. are tools that we use to do what we're interested in...(This is in no way to denigrate math or programming)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2182031 href="vote?for=2182031&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%73%5a%32%65%62%73%52%79%68"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2182031></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=RK">RK</a> 365 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2182031">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The head of the program was a cosmologist, actually. I know that she taught herself to code, as did the other two profs I worked for. -I think that had something to do with their attitudes. Also, it might have just been from a practicality standpoint. We didn't have the room for multiple CS courses, and the students seemed to be able to pick it up well enough to do what they needed to.<p>I have to mention, I did take a 100-level CS course as an elective, and personally, it was too basic. I think to get what we needed, we would have had to skip the intro courses, and I it's possible the CS department would have frowned on that. On a related note, my PhD was in medical physics, and our department did have an agreement with the bio department to let us take a 400 level physiology class without the prereqs. It was a point-of-pride in the physics program that our students always lead those classes.<p>No doubt CS can get deep and anyone that codes could benefit from those higher-level courses. But, I think the situation wouldn't allow for that.<p>Maybe she was saying that physics students were bright enough to figure out what they needed on their own. From what I saw, she would be correct there. We weren't <i>math</i> majors, but we were pretty able. :)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2180791 href="vote?for=2180791&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%73%5a%32%65%62%73%52%79%68"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2180791></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=scott_s">scott_s</a> 366 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2180791">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#5a5a5a>Who is to say the "legitimate" startup deserves the money in the first place?  The way I see it, if you're legitimate you should be at break even, investment isn't to dig a company out of a hole but rather to accelerate growth and development.  I remember the Twilio CEO saying on Mixergy that they needed investment because without it they wouldn't have been able to grow/build as fast.  They didn't need it to stay alive, but they wouldn't be where they are now without it.  If a startup dies because of a lack of capital that's their own fault and they probably didn't have a company worth investing in in the first place.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2171374 href="vote?for=2171374&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%73%5a%32%65%62%73%52%79%68"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2171374></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=prodigal_erik">prodigal_erik</a> 368 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2171374">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>YC isn't the same as VC.  I should have been a little more clear in my first comment.  It's not like I think angels or incubators that make small investments are making bad investments in these young companies.  I went through an incubator with my first company, so I know first hand giving those opportunities is priceless.<p>We're talking about VC funding here.  No company goes after VC on day one.  All these companies that get millions in series whatever rounds are mature and have some revenue coming in, or at least a plan to turn their userbase into dollars.  If a company is mature enough to seek VC funding and also needs that investment to dig themselves out of a hole, then I don't think they're worth investing in.  That's all I'm saying, hopefully it makes sense.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2174469 href="vote?for=2174469&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%73%5a%32%65%62%73%52%79%68"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2174469></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=arethuza">arethuza</a> 367 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2174469">link</a></span></div><br>

Every time I have wanted to do something in the past few years, the first question that came to me was, "How much time will this take away from my work?"  At first, if the answer was nonzero, I didn't do it.  But I have slowly learned that nonzero answers were OK, and in many cases, quite welcome.<p><i>About a year ago I vowed that I'd quit HN on the day that I'd pass 50,000 karma...</i><p>Funny, some time ago, I vowed that I'd never quit HN, no matter how high (or low) my ROI.  I was one of the first ones here and plan to be here to help turn out the lights (perish the thought).<p>Jacques, please understand that you are part of my addiction to HN.  Your contributions have been priceless.  I suspect you have reached the point in your life where you have a responsibility to "pass on" the gifts you have received.

I hope you haven't pulled a Matt Maroon and obfuscated your password.  I urge you to reconsider.  It <i>is</i> possible for an addictive overachiever to get most of his work done and still be part of HN.  I am living proof.<p>Part of being a successful achiever is not giving up.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Getting work done is one thing. Taking your work another level (for whatever reason) is another thing.<p>There are many "interesting" stories floating around HN about startups, companies, success stories, and probably technical superiority. Sometime, people want to be in the storyline and not on the bench having long-winded arguments (not discussion, but arguments as if there should be one true answer).<p>I joined HN more than 3.5 years ago. A few months ago, I began to disengage from HN. My life turned around for the better. I lost weight, got more things done (not just work, but other things in life), met new people, learned a lot more, understand myself better, and overall, happier. I know some of you become friends here but you know that awkward feeling when you actually meet your online friend in real life? ... yeah... I got that feeling so I know it's not working for me.<p>Not all people have the same feeling/outcome like I do. Maybe it's just my personality that I tend to be more outgoing in real-life than spending time online arguing about Python vs Ruby, VCs vs Angels, Apple vs Google, the future (those discussions were fun had I read them less frequent).<p>Being part of HN feels akin to the starbuck-laptop-user lifestyle, Godin/Tim Ferriss/GTD readers, MBA grads. People want to be a part of a community that they think special (or can improve themselves). Maybe they would, who knows.<p>At the end of the day, I felt that it's time for me to move on.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Maybe I'm a little mixed up, but OP and I must have very different definitions of "bootstrapping".  I am really confused by 3 of his graphs.<p><i>Support for start-ups</i><p><pre><code>  1. Savings              - 33%
  2. Savings + Consulting - 41%
  3. Consulting           - 15%
  4. Angel Investment     -  5%
  5. Friends &#38; Family     - 15%
</code></pre>
Category 1 sounds like they're true bootstrappers.  Categories 2 and 3 sound suspiciously like service businesses and side projects.  Categories 4 and 5 are not bootstrapped.<p><i>I define a start-up as having about 6 different stages I define them as follows:</i><p><pre><code>  1. Early Stage Concept  -  7%
  2. Developing Prototype - 32%
  3. Pitching             - 13%
  4. Finish Prototype     - 15%
  5. Start Selling        - 29%
  6. Scale Up             -  8%
</code></pre>
Why isn't "Start Selling" first?  Better yet, why isn't "Find Out What People Want and Will Pay For" first?  Why are so many people building stuff that may not even be wanted?<p>Why not:<p><pre><code>  1. Find Out What People Want
  2. Show Them a Prototype
  3. Collect Deposits
  4. Build It
  5. Find Other Instances of Those People and Convert Them

</code></pre>
<i>What is holding you back?</i><p><pre><code>  1. Prototype not ready             - 28%
  2. Prototype needs to change       -  9%
  3. Can't find customers            -  9%
  4. Not enough time (consulting)    - 12%
  5. Need cash injection to scale up - 37%
  </code></pre>
It sounds like most of the companies either (a) haven't sold anything or (b) haven't sold enough to keep bootstrapping.  Are these start-ups or are these side projects?<p>I wonder how many of the 107 companies raised the same questions I did.  <i>That's</i> something I'd really like to know.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2127936 href="vote?for=2127936&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%73%5a%32%65%62%73%52%79%68"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2127936></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=edw519">edw519</a> 380 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2127936">link</a> | <a href="item?id=2127744">parent</a> | on: <a href="item?id=2127744">Vivian Maier: A life's work seen for first time</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; <i>"That some of our abilities are inherent. They just have to be set free."</i><p>Heavily disagreed. I'm a street photographer myself (self-trained), and Maier's work has been inspiring both from an artistic and motivational perspective.<p>These abilities aren't "inherent". They take years and years of practice to hone, and a constant criticism of your own work (from yourself or otherwise).<p>I don't think any photographer ever picked up a camera, figured out how to work it, and then just started taking good work. Bear in mind also that I don't know a single street photographer who's able to shoot anything close to &#62;5% keepers, much less show-ers.<p>When you view art like this, keep in mind that not only is it a highly selected slice of the artist's entire body of work, but also you are looking at what is most likely their top work at the prime of their abilities.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It depends what you mean by 'an artist'. Consider that every one of us is constantly expressing ourselves, in unique ways and with a unique personality, in language. There's no reason you can't train someone to have similar competency to express themselves in another medium.<p>People who attend those 'drawing from life' courses invariably are much better by the end of it. I knew a guy who didn't have a lot of artistic flair, but he liked cars and machines. By the end of the course he was producing some really precise, great looking drawings of vehicles and engines.<p>If you define 'an artist' as someone who's able to move the state of the art, create bold new visions -- well, not everyone may be capable of that.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; If you define 'an artist' as someone who's able to move the state of the art, create bold new visions -- well, not everyone may be capable of that. But I think that's an unnecessarily narrow conception of art.<p>Agreed. I don't think you can 'train' someone to be a cultural revolutionary. Look at Stephen King, he spent virtually his entire life writing stories, the education he received only served to skip him past mistakes he would have run into and figured out by himself sooner or later.<p>There are however countless thousands of people out there writing nothing more than pulp fiction, entertaining people and probably only making enough cash to help put their kids through college or to pay for a nice vacation next year.<p>I used to play bass guitar, I used to write my own songs, I knew a few people who genuinely liked them. If I'd have put as much effort into my music as I have writing then I would probably genuinely be a musician right now, but I want to be an author because since I could talk I've been telling stories.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2131073 href="vote?for=2131073&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%73%5a%32%65%62%73%52%79%68"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2131073></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=wglb">wglb</a> 379 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2131073">link</a></span></div><br>
