<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>but how would it actually work?</i><p>Exactly as I propose in grandparent.  Reread it if necessary.<p><i>they usually want to know about the work relation you had with the reference.</i><p>I will tell them that we are colleagues on-line.  Although we have never met in real life, we participate in Hacker News together.  Believe me, I know much more about lots of people here than many I know in real life.  For example, I would heartily recommend patio11, kirubakaran, iamelgringo, or tptacek over some guy down the hall who I know nothing about except sports conversations at the coffee machine.  It is 2010: in our industry, virtual relationships can easily carry as much weight as physical ones.<p><i>Just inventing something is dangerous and ethically questionable, recruiters or not.</i><p>There is nothing ethically questionable about my offer.  I will tell the truth.  I will also include this thread.  Recruiters have created an artificial roadblock to keep people from working by protecting their turf.  This is just a handy method to turn that roadblock into a speed bump.  If they are required to collect professional references, this helps them satisfy their requirement.<p>I operate under the assumption that everyone is telling the truth until I find out that they aren't.  Then I have nothing more to do with them.  So, your CV and a phone interview should be more than enough for a recruiter to qualify you.  It they can't (or won't), then one of two things must be true: either they are mining CVs or they are incompetent.<p><i>Then, what if the hiring company actually contacted you?</i><p>I fully expect them to and I will tell them the truth, including this thread.  AFAIC, your CV, phone interview, and participation on Hacker News deserves at least a minimal amount of respect from hiring people.  Requiring references prematurely is unnecessary and insulting.<p>I (obviously) feel very strongly about this and stand by my original offer to anyone here.<p>A few asides:<p>1. I <i>never</i> give references until <i>after</i> receiving a job offer (contingent upon acceptable references).  If a company is incapable or unwilling to make a preliminary decision based upon the interaction between me and any number of their employees, then I don't want to work for them.<p>2. I have a great deal of respect for competent and professional recruiters.  But then again, you're probably not reading this because you were able to do your jobs without references in the first place.<p>3. To recruiters who are mining CVs, representing jobs that don't exist, or misrepresenting jobs to protect your listings, please understand that I (and probably most of the competent professional programmers here) want nothing to do with you.  Please become professional or just go away.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_1873096 href="vote?for=1873096&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%32%4a%56%6c%78%74%51%35%38"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_1873096></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=thomas11">thomas11</a> 456 days ago  | <a href="item?id=1873096">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thanks for your detailed response (and the original offer!).<p>I had understood your proposal just fine, and was wondering about the recruiters' side. I and surely most of us on HN agree with what you wrote on virtual relationships, fairly assessing a candidate based on the CV, and handling personal references with respect.<p>However, will such an HN reference pass the recruiter, and then the hiring person at the company? A technically clueless HR person won't be too impressed by "this guy on a web forum says my Hello World is fine". Again, I agree that in an ideal world, they would call the candidate and figure out his skills on their own, but they don't.<p>In any case, I'll bookmark your original post, one never knows :-)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_1873836 href="vote?for=1873836&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%32%4a%56%6c%78%74%51%35%38"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_1873836></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mediaman">mediaman</a> 456 days ago  | <a href="item?id=1873836">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>I don't even want to think about my death, I just want to keep on living my life.</i><p>Aging is ridiculously unfair, but ignoring it doesn't stop it from happening. The Reaper keeps track of the beads whether or not you do. People get old. Their bodies and minds slowly break down. At some point they have to stop working, stop driving, stop doing lots of things they love doing.<p>This accounting of days sounds depressing at first, but I can speak from experience: you soon go back to your normal level of happiness, but with a more accurate view of reality. I think a similar thing happens with terminally ill patients, although the time scale is shorter.<p>The terminal illness analogy maps pretty well to aging. So much so that I encourage people to donate to anti-aging research such as the Methuselah Foundation (<a href="https://www.mfoundation.org/?pn=mj_donate" rel="nofollow">https://www.mfoundation.org/?pn=mj_donate</a>) or SENS (<a href="http://www.sens.org/donate" rel="nofollow">http://www.sens.org/donate</a>).

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Don't get me wrong; I wouldn't mind an eternal or greatly extended life. But seeing as how I will not be cognizant of my nonexistence upon my death, I don't think it's worth getting too hung up about. I am probably too old to make the cutoff for the singularity -- or whatever similar event might kick off the path to eternal or thousand-year lifespans. So I find that it's best to maintain a cautiously optimistic attitude about my mortality. I am not expecting immortality, but it would be nice.<p><i>Would you condemn others to the same fate?</i><p>I don't think that's a fair question, given that I haven't said anything of the sort. I would love for everyone to live as long as they could and prosper to whatever extent they could.

I still do, but colleges are essentially bureaucratic hucksterism. So a lot people think I missed out -- on high school, college, everything.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This is a great book!  AFAIC, a must read for anyone here who is serious about their startup.<p>I read it on the flight to Startup School a few weeks ago to "get in the mood".  I couldn't put it down.<p>It's easy to read for 2 reasons: every chapter is a short essay by a different person (including many techstar alumni) and it's very well written, almost like pg essays but by lots of different people.  It covers lots of ground, much of which has been covered here at hn many times, but then again, some of this stuff can't be covered too often.  Also, sometimes someone says the same thing a little differently, and that's the one that actually reaches you.<p>My 300 page copy has 50 or 60 dog-earred pages and hundreds of red marks; it's that full of gems.  (For that reason, I highly suggest buying a hard copy and keeping it on your bookshelf for future reference.)<p>I think that yc should come out with a similar book.  I'd love to read essays from yc alumni, their advisors, and of course the yc principals themselves about what they thought was important.  I realize much of this is on-line already, but there's nothing like a great hard copy too.<p>A few of my favorite quotes from _Do More Faster_:<p>"I realized that I had two options.  I could quit buying comics or I could quit my job and build the iTunes of comics." - Kevin Mann<p>"Getting feedback and new ideas is the lifeblood of any startup.  There is no point in living in fear of someone stealing your idea." - Nate Abbott and Natty Zola<p>"That means every moment you're working on something without it being in the public arena, it's actually dying, deprived of the oxygen of the real world." - Matt Mullenweb<p>"Focus on the smallest possible problem you could solve that would potentially be useful" - David Cohen<p>"You know you're on to something when the community starts donating money to make sure it stays alive." - Darren Crystal<p>"In companies that rely on having a large user base as ours does, it is very unlikely that you will offend enough people quickly enough to dampen your future growth." - Sean Corbett<p>"We learned that very few people care how you accomplish something.  Instead, these people care more about whether you create value for your end user." - Colin Angle<p>"We knew that the high-level concept of our first site still really inspired us." - Alex White<p>"They stepped back from what they had created and thought about what they could do better than anyone else in the world." - editors<p>"During the first few days of every TechStars cycle, we tell the 10 bright-eyed new teams that one of them will not be together at the end of the program.  Unfortunately, we have not been wrong yet." - editors<p>"If you can't quit no matter how hard you try, then you have a chance to succeed." - Laura Fitton<p>"When you ask CEOs of major companies what they're most worried about, one common answer is 'a couple of guys in a garage somewhere.'" - David Cohen<p>"Companies that work just always seem to move at lightning pace." - David Cohen<p>"It turns out that giving up your one obvious competitive advantage often proves to be deadly.  If a startup can't do more faster, it usually just gets dead faster." - David Cohen<p>"There is an enormous difference between exciting technology and an exciting business." - Howard Diamond<p>"Changes come daily, weekly, and monthly - not once a quarter or once a year." - Ari Newman<p>"While it was only a detour of a week, that's a lot in TechStars time." - Bill Warner<p>"Only hope instead is to listen to their head and their heart and follow a path that they believe in, keeping some of the feedback and discarding other thoughts and ideas." - Bill Warner<p>"...when presented with exponential growth, remember that people tend to drastically overestimate what will happen in the short term, but will profoundly underestimate what happens over longer time spans." - Ryan McIntyre<p>"...consider life as a founder of a startup to be one big intelligence test." - Ryan McIntyre<p>"Remember that human nature has a tendency to admire complexity, but to reward simplicity." - Ben Huh<p>"If you are innovating, you actually don't know what your product needs to be.  Furthermore, your customers don't either.  No one does." - Ajay Kulkarni and Andy Cheung<p>"Nearly every startup must find ways to differentiate itself from competitors." - Raj Aggarwai<p>"What is the thing that matters most to making progress right now?" - Dick Costolo<p>"...you cannot create the need." - Michael Zeissner<p>"Opportunity cost can kill a startup." - Michael Zeissner<p>"It's easy to feel trapped by these handcuffs but if you change your perspective just a little, you might find that you hands are bound by nothing more than air, and the future is yours to create." - Eric Marcoullier<p>"There is one thing that the hundred of founders I meet each year have in common, and that is that their plan is wrong.  Sometimes it's the big things, sometimes it's the little things, but the plan is always wrong." - Rob Hayes<p>"...we have to strike while the iron is hot!  My experience is that this is rarely true." - David Brown<p>"Take the time to get it right and you'll find that those competitors might not be as close as you think." - David Brown<p>"Seeking the perfect combo: 'a smart-ass team with a kick-ass product in a big-ass market.'" - Jeff Clavier<p>"The moral of the story is easy:  When you follow your heart, good things usually happen.  We have a very short stay on this spinning  orb and I believe life is way too short to be stuck in a career that doesn't fulfill you." - Mark Solon</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_1865920 href="vote?for=1865920&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%32%4a%56%6c%78%74%51%35%38"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_1865920></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=BrandonM">BrandonM</a> 458 days ago  | <a href="item?id=1865920">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thank you for this wonderful post!  I was beginning to feel left out.<p>While the rest of the U.S. is consumed with mid-term election results, World Series celebrations, fantasy football, Survivor, and Justin Bieber thinking he can dance with 5th graders, we hackers pay little attention and keep on working.<p>Then you guys come along with fresh hacker-friendly drama.  Thank you!  It's been 3 weeks since Angelgate, and things were beginning to get monotonous alt-tabbing between my IDE, my debugger, my test runs, email, and hacker news.<p>&#60;/sarcasm&#62;<p>Now that the sarcasm tag has been lifted, let me say what I really think:<p>Why is it that those of you who have so much spend so much energy being drama queens?  We hackers struggle every day, sometimes for years, building stuff, but if we fart wrong during a pitch, you send us on our way as if nothing we ever did matters.  Anyone who comes to this board can bitch and moan about a million different things, but most of us don't; we just keep on working.<p>Why don't you all just STFU and do the same.  There's already too much drama and too much work to be done.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Ed this was the ugliest post I've seen on HN -- that I was extremely happy to upvote.<p>Really guys. Enough with the drama. Get a therapist, join a yoga club. Anything but the continuous gossipy spam that keeps flooding the boards. We're out here struggling day-to-day: take your spectacle/drama-of-the-week onto Oprah or Dr. Phil or something. But please not here.<p>You know, the 1-of drama posts are fine: "My cofounder left me for IBM". I can handle those every now and then. But this shit has gotten into a business where hackers just waste their time speculating on it. It's like soap operas for hackers.

It will eliminate argument strings between 2 people.<p>2. It will remove the incentive to flame because your flame <i>can't</i> turn into an argument.<p>3. It will encourage people to think through what they have to say, anticipate counter-arguments, and address them in their original comment (or with an update in the 2 hour edit window).<p>4. It will foster a greater sense of community by encouraging people to stick up for each other.  (PersonA made a good comment, PersonB trolled, PersonA can't reply, so I will.)  PersonB will get the message much better when confronted by the community instead of PersonA.  (Of course, if no one sticks up for PersonA, then maybe they really were wrong.)<p>5. It will encourage 2 people to take their legitimate discussion (of little interest to others) off-line.<p>6. It will reduce the length and indentation of threads making them easier to read.<p>7.

Trolls will get more satisfaction somewhere else.<p>(This is already working by accident.  I have gotten so busy that I only visit hn in short bursts.

That's a lot more rare than two people griping back and forth - but what price would you pay for the sublime?<p>You would really lose the 'discussion' aspect of things by turning it into a 'say once' system.<p>People in complex situations almost never behave exactly as you'd expect them to.  An artificial limit to discussion might have terrible unintended consequences.
What about the problem of someone asking a question in their comment.<p>"Hey, wait a second, what did you mean by X?"

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Good point.  (I guess I wouldn't have been able to say that if we adopted my suggestion.)  Maybe a one reply limit instead of a zero reply limit.<p>I know the time delay thing was a good start.  I just think it needs to be extended.  It seems that threads lose value as they get deeper.<p>Oh, and I just thought of #8: It encourages you to get back to work since you won't be replying.  That's something everyone needs to consider.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_1853275 href="vote?for=1853275&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%32%4a%56%6c%78%74%51%35%38"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_1853275></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=DeusExMachina">DeusExMachina</a> 461 days ago  | <a href="item?id=1853275">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This to counter number 1, but I see other issues too:<p>2. Trolls do not care who replies. This can avoid the argument between the OP and the troll, but does not prevent the latter to post the snarky comment in the first place. Some people just want to express their frustration attacking someone, they do not care about replies. Moreover, the lack of chance for the OP to reply could even incentivize the bad behaviour, giving the flamer a sort of "revenge" weapon. People often find gratification in silencing others.<p>3. Some discussions give value to the community because they happen in a short lapse of time. If someone needs 2 hours to reply, then there is a chance fewer people will see it.<p>4. As I said, trolls just want replies, from anyone. Flaming the full community could even be more satisfactory to him.<p>5. Unfortunately often there is no way of doing this because some users do not have their address in their profile.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_1853240 href="vote?for=1853240&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%7a%32%4a%56%6c%78%74%51%35%38"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_1853240></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pornel">pornel</a> 461 days ago  | <a href="item?id=1853240">link</a></span></div><br>
