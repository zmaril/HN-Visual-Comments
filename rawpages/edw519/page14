So in typical hacker fashion, I "launched" what I had with the intention of accepting feedback and iterating.  You guys have always been really good at that.<p>I originally planned on a Kindle ebook, but Scribd was just so much easier for me.  I didn't realize that others had problems viewing or purchasing.  If you're outside the U.S. or have any other problems reading the sample, just email me and I'll send you a free pdf.<p>All of your feedback is greatly appreciated.  I'll keep updating the content as I go and will gladly accept help with typesetting or distributing.  I plan to follow up with some of you during one of my breaks today.<p>If you buy the book and don't like it, I will buy you a cup of coffee the next time we are together.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Actually, it's pretty simple: supply and demand.<p>In the B2B world, there is a stunning demand for good software everywhere I go.  Two and three year project queues are the norm.  They have trouble finding <i>anyone</i> to get the work done, whether it's employees, contractors, or vendors, either for services or products.<p>Perfect example right now: I know of two large companies whose customers are demanding that they be able to enter their orders on the internet.  Imagine, in 2011, large companies struggling to find people to get e-commerce working!<p>OTOH, I read about what other programmers are doing here on hn, and 90% of the time, my first thought is, "Why?  Who would pay for that?"<p>To make it on your own, you have to stop building what you think people will pay for and start building what they actually will pay for.  Huge difference.<p>Aside: I remember talking about something very simliar a few weeks ago here:<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2363723" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2363723</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2433128 href="vote?for=2433128&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%32%61%33%52%39%5a%41%4a%62%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2433128></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=raganwald">raganwald</a> 299 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2433128">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>Actually, it's pretty simple: supply and demand.</i><p>My experience is that supply and demand only explains/models pricing when you have an efficient market. When there are information asymmetries or actors attempting to impose inefficiencies in a market, supply and demand breaks badly.<p>To quote one of Joel's best posts:<p><i>Software is priced three ways: free, cheap, and dear.</i><p><i>1. Free. Open source, etc. Not relevant to the current discussion. Nothing to see here. Move along.</i><p><i>2. Cheap. $10 - $1000, sold to a very large number of people at a low price without a salesforce. Most shrinkwrapped consumer and small business software falls into this category.</i><p><i>3. Dear. $75,000 - $1,000,000, sold to a handful of rich big companies using a team of slick salespeople that do six months of intense PowerPoint just to get one goddamn sale. The Oracle model.</i><p><i>All three methods work fine.</i><p><i>Notice the gap? There's no software priced between $1000 and $75,000. I'll tell you why. The minute you charge more than $1000 you need to get serious corporate signoffs. You need a line item in their budget. You need purchasing managers and CEO approval and competitive bids and paperwork. So you need to send a salesperson out to the customer to do PowerPoint, with his airfare, golf course memberships, and $19.95 porn movies at the Ritz Carlton. And with all this, the cost of making one successful sale is going to average about $50,000. If you're sending salespeople out to customers and charging less than $75,000, you're losing money.</i><p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckie...</a><p>With behaviour like that, supply and demand is absolutely the least important factor in making certain B2B sales. Doubling the supply of "dearly priced" software can't drive the price below $75,000 because it costs $50,000 to make a sale. What's interesting is the opportunity to innovate to make the jump from "dear" to "cheap." That's a business model problem, not a supply problem. In my uninformed and inexpert opinion.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2433685 href="vote?for=2433685&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%32%61%33%52%39%5a%41%4a%62%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2433685></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=illumen">illumen</a> 299 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2433685">link</a></span></div><br>

Get out of your office and find people like this first.  Ask them, not us, what they want.  Then figure out how to provide them with what they crave.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>edw519, I think your advice is in the right spirit but (as you admit) naïve.<p>nopassrecover, edw is 100% on target about looking outward. However actors, salons, and teachers are all good examples of people with little money to spend, who would not capture significant extra margins by adding software.<p>In my estimation, nopassrecover, you would do better to think deeper in the B2B value chain, particularly if you can flex relationships you've made in previous industries you've worked in. Imagine how many more people you could touch writing software that hooks into a shoe factory's shoe machines than making a web store -- and how much less of a customer's attention that would require.<p>Two consejos that I think are good (but not necessary) for entrepreneurs to follow:<p>1. Do a part-time job while you work on your own thing.<p>2. Use knowledge &#38; relationships from businesses you have worked in directly.<p>And (3) for hackers specifically: spend some time thinking about and researching how the commercial world fits together. Who made the plastic fibres in the salon's brush? How does the aesthetic layout of the salon enable them to charge more? What other construction materials could they have used? What catalogs are thrust in the face of new salon owners and how does that affect the way they see their choices? What's the price history of the real estate they own vis-à-vis the other places they could have set up shop? And more generally: What companies in the world do the most revenue and why? What companies have the most profits?<p>The salon scheduling example is particularly naïve, because scheduling software would not add much value to either salon owners or customers.<p>But edw519, I very much agree with you about looking outward (both to meet business minded people and to meet people who don't have iPhones).</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2434665 href="vote?for=2434665&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%32%61%33%52%39%5a%41%4a%62%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2434665></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dbuxton">dbuxton</a> 299 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2434665">link</a></span></div><br>

Going to try SEO?  Your competition has going full steam with SEO-- how are you going to compete?  Adwords?  Most SMB SaaS can't afford adwords.  Facebook ads?  Bit of a minefield, but possible.  Word of mouth?  There's a lot of noise out there<p>In other words, have a customer acquisition plan and be prepared for that to be your fulltime job.  37Signals, with their early fame and following, took <i>12 months</i> before they could afford to set aside consulting.

But if you're just working on another straightforward B2B e-commerce platform marketed at the 10% of companies left who don't yet have a web presence, although you might have a greater chance of getting rich, you're not chasing the dream.  And the people who see nothing wrong with this never become entrepreneurs, they just avoid the risk altogether and make a good living working at a big company.<p>It obviously doesn't happen in all cases (and I certainly don't mean to imply that there is nothing interesting and game-changing to be done in B2B businesses), but I think this could be part of the reason why entrepreneurs are always building things they hope people will pay for rather than things people already do pay for.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2436135 href="vote?for=2436135&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%32%61%33%52%39%5a%41%4a%62%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2436135></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=crasshopper">crasshopper</a> 298 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2436135">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>OK, let me give this a shot...<p>In the past year or two, I have learned my greatest life lesson.  As a lifelong high achiever, it was extremely counter-intuitive yet it was right in front of me all along.  First, a little background...<p>In the past couple of years:<p><pre><code>  - My father died.
  - My aunt (and best friend) died.
  - My cousin (who was really like my brother) died.
  - My 19 year old cat died.
  - We had our first ever family reunion.
  - My mother's dimentia has turned her back into a child.
  </code></pre>
Sure we all have great memories and are busy working at building even better futures, but ultimately it all boils down to:<p>All we have is now.<p>My pets have been trying to teach me this for years, if only I had listened.  And now my mother is teaching me.  They don't really remember yesterday.  They don't care about tomorrow.  But they really care about the moment.  Intensely.<p>I have had to really slow down and let this sink in.  When I visit my mother in her nursing home, we have a great time laughing, talking, visiting others, and of course, playing Jeopardy.  We can't have the conversations we used to, so we just have new experiences, one time only, in the moment, and only for those who are there.  We never talk about the past and she simply doesn't understand, "I'll see you tomorrow."<p>I haven't stopped building my future, but I no longer sacrifice the present in order to get there.  I have learned that the process must be as enjoyable as the outcome.  After all, the process is "now" and the outcome is just an instant in time.<p>It may sound cliche, but everyone should take inventory of all the good stuff in their lives (especially other people) and make the most of it <i>now</i>.  You'll be surprised how quickly it'll be gone.  Don't wait half your life to learn my most valuable counter-intuitive lesson.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2375114 href="vote?for=2375114&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%32%61%33%52%39%5a%41%4a%62%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2375114></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ihodes">ihodes</a> 314 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2375114">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It does sound cliché. And, respectfully, I think it's just as wrong [Edit: not wrong, but maybe shortsighted. Then again, if what I say in the following paragraphs doesn't change your view in the slightest, then more power to you: my view isn't the absolute. Do what you think is "right", whatever right might be.]  as most clichés tend to be.<p>We have now, certainly, and now is amazing. But we have the past, too; at least for a while (dementia and all sorts of other things can rob us of the past). We have the future, too (though we can be robbed of that).<p><i>I live for all three.</i> The past is where I draw from to inform my present actions; the present is where I enjoy myself and prepare for the future; the future is where we're all heading.<p>If I lived for the now, I wouldn't be going to college. I wouldn't be planning to study for a PhD in Neuroscience and researching assistive brain/spine implants. I wouldn't study programming languages and designs. I wouldn't be reading The Intelligent Investor. In fact, if you lived for the now, you'd probably be living in a soma-induced haze à la Huxley's Brave New World: it'd be the optimal choice, in fact. Pure neurochemical bliss.<p>The argument that you should live for now because you could be dead at <i>any</i> second is obscene, to me: it's more likely that you live than you die, and you're likely to be consistently happier now and in the future if you act like you'll be alive in the future. Evidence: planning for retirement. Seriously.<p>So live for yourself, sure, but live for all of yourself. Think of yourself as a smudge on a timeline: not in one place, not just in the past, not just in the future.

I went because it was time - all the adults around me said that I'd be missing out on an awesome experience if I didn't, and while I was a little skeptical, I figured I'd give it a try.  That, and the economy was about to enter the shitter (it was 2001), and the company I was working at was about to lay off 40% of its workforce.<p>I majored in physics because I liked the feeling of sitting out on my roof with sunshine on my face (yeah, New England, it didn't last very long), textbook in my lap, working on really hard math problems.  As it turned out, I didn't like it enough to stick with it.  I then majored in computer science because I had found out that I liked it enough to spend my weekends working on compilers and my late nights reading up on programming language design.  At the time I did those, I was a physics major, and they were completely irrelevant to anything that might possibly advance my degree or career.  But they were fun.<p>I read The Intelligent Investor because I'd just started working at a financial software startup, had an hour long commute, and figured it might be more fun to figure out what I'd just gotten myself into rather than stare at the silent faces on the train.  As it turned out, after reading The Intelligent Investor I didn't much like what I'd gotten myself into at all, which is why I'm not in finance now.<p>In one of Paul Graham's essays, he says that you can tell an adult from a child because an adult will tend to "lean into" challenges, accepting them as part of who they are instead of shrinking back from them.  There's nothing that prevents you from building the habit of leaning into challenges into your daily identity.  It doesn't particularly matter what those challenges are, it matters that you attack them.  If you build this habit, you'll usually do fairly well even if you don't make a master plan for your life.  Heck, you'll probably do better than people who do create a master plan, because life has a way of biting you in the ass and tearing your plans to shreds.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2376860 href="vote?for=2376860&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%32%61%33%52%39%5a%41%4a%62%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2376860></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dmoney">dmoney</a> 313 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2376860">link</a></span></div><br>

Someone who's not yet an adult will tend to respond to a challenge from an adult in a way that acknowledges their dominance. If an adult says "that's a stupid idea," a kid will either crawl away with his tail between his legs, or rebel. But rebelling presumes inferiority as much as submission. The adult response to "that's a stupid idea," is simply to look the other person in the eye and say "Really?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Clichés are clichés for a reason.<p>Yes, we have past, present, and future. But you can't change past: it's gone so in the end it's not much to live for. You can't live for future either: you can just project <i>now</i> into something you think would be a good future. Thus, even planning for future happens <i>now</i>. It is <i>now</i> when anything happens and where any choices are made. Past and future are important and useful, but they only exist as concepts in your mind.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think one of the key words here that the OP didn't use was "for." I.e. he never said "I live for the present."<p>Rather, I think the word he was going for (correct me if I'm wrong) was "in." I.e. "Live in the present moment." Don't live in the past, don't live in the future, etc...<p>And that to truly live in the present moment, you have to take the wisdom of the past, and consider the weight your actions will hold in the future, but ultimately all you have is now. So I don't think what you said goes against what the OP said, it just highlights a different aspect. The past was lived, the future will be lived, but your decisions will be most important when they happen. You're not living if you're stuck in the past or displacing the present for some hazy future (a young investment banker working 100 hours a week for...).<p>Also, there are "present" qualities in all the examples you gave. Assistive brain/spine implants improves the present moment living conditions of other humans. We can use programming and the skills we have to build tools that help people better live their lives.<p>Also, things like love and other people are strongest in the present moment. Ultimately we likely invest and we study because so that we can make ourselves happy or search outside of ourselves, but a lot of times it's a lot closer (both physically and temporally) than we might think.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2375290 href="vote?for=2375290&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%32%61%33%52%39%5a%41%4a%62%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2375290></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=k7d">k7d</a> 314 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2375290">link</a></span></div><br>
