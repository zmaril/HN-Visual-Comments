A six+ month buying cycle for anything over 4 figures is normal.  Whenever selling to an enterprise, you should ask your contact:<p><pre><code>  1.  Who is the champion?
  2.  Who is the decision maker?
  3.  What is the process for each tier?
  4.  What should we do the best ensure our mutual success?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62;&#62;But why are these things so often scheduled for weekdays?<p>In our case, a couple reasons:<p>1. We surveyed about a dozen people interested in attending and nearly all of them said they couldn't do a weekend, but could make weekdays work. Obviously 12 people is a small sample size, but the response was overwhelming.<p>2. Since we are trying to keep the ticket cost as low as possible, weekdays are ideal since they are cheaper for the hotels we looked at.<p>But I certainly understand your point; for some people weekends would be better. For others, weekdays.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2309864 href="vote?for=2309864&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%53%63%32%78%75%72%58%66%56%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2309864></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=edw519">edw519</a> 331 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2309864">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There's one other huge factor at work here (for many programmers, anyway).  I'm tempted to call it the "wimp factor", but that's too negative, so I'll just call it the "introvert factor".  I'm a perfect example...<p>I was always small for my age and looked nerdy with my glasses and attraction to books, etc.  I was always picked last for sports teams, drew little attention from girls, and was usually the first one to be bullied.  It even happened in my own family, subconsciously I hope.  It was always easier to pick on the little guy to get what you want.<p>Fast forward to adulthood, and not much has changed, especially with bosses.  It seems like my boss was always a sales/business guy, extroverted, and bigger than me.  His/her natural reaction was to "bully", probably because they knew they could get away with it.  This was for almost everything: project management, discussions about work, and of course, money.<p>No more.  I don't know exactly when it happened, but I decided not to take this shit any more.  The more anyone picked on me, the harder I shot back, right between the eyes.  Nothing pisses me off more than being bullied, especially about money.<p>This is not natural behavior for me.  (I imagine if it was natural, I would have become a sales person or a lawyer.)  I have to consciously work hard to stick up for myself.  But as soon as I paint the other person, especially my boss, as a bully, I put myself on even ground.  And as soon as they see that, they understand that they can no longer take advantage of me.  Only then can I be treated like everyone else.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2309671 href="vote?for=2309671&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%53%63%32%78%75%72%58%66%56%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2309671></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=blhack">blhack</a> 331 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2309671">link</a></span></div><br>

The problem is that many people (including myself) are not working for (and possibly won't find) managers with this view towards hiring.<p>Many managers hire people as a sudden reactionary event ("we have an open rec, we've got to hire before the rec closes!"), leading to rushed hiring decisions, and then negotiation issues a year later where you ended up hiring someone (and they took the offer) out of immediacy / desperation, and the employee ends up leaving or accepts the lack of interest and doesn't work to his/her full potential.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2312854 href="vote?for=2312854&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%53%63%32%78%75%72%58%66%56%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2312854></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sp4rki">sp4rki</a> 330 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2312854">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It doesn't have to be miserable at all. If your profits doubled this year and some employees are the reason for such an increase, then you would be a jerk to play hardball with said employees about salary increases. Now if your company took a negative hit and an employee that doesn't really create a decent amount of value asks for a raise, then he's a jerk for not having the company's best interest in mind (and if his performance is not good enough you should be thinking about letting him go anyways).<p>Hell the whole point of working is to advance in the world. You as an employer should be making more money with each year that passes in comparison to past years. Employees as people with goals and dreams should be making more money as time passes also. If you're making more money thanks to your employees, your employees should be making more money also. Not just because they're entitled to it, but because there's always the possibility that by letting them go could end up costing you more money than a raise of a couple of thousand dollars.<p>A great team is something you should strive to maintain and cherish, but is also something that becomes exponentially more expensive as years pass. If they're working like a well oiled machine and creating insane amounts of value for your company, just pay up. If by comparison they're average (or worse) and your company isn't growing one bit because of lack of innovation or performance on their part, then you're correct in playing hardball... while you look for replacements that can actually benefit your company.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2309808 href="vote?for=2309808&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%53%63%32%78%75%72%58%66%56%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2309808></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=analyst74">analyst74</a> 331 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2309808">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm in a similar situation as analyst74. I used to be rather introverted, but in the recent years I started thinking of interaction with people I don't know that well a game of sorts.<p>Oftentimes, people are far more relaxed and natural with their friends than they are with co-workers or strangers. Subconsciously, we assign these 'roles' for ourselves (you with friends, you online, you on the bus, you at the doctor's office etc) and stick to them. Breaking the boundaries of the roles a bit and being the same across the board is what I found to be quite helpful in being more social and just feeling better about life overall. For example, I'll randomly chat up a stranger waiting for a delayed bus; make eye contact and smile at a person random person on the subway (especially if attractive ;P); or talk to or play with someone's kid while on a train (kids are usually very approachable and love playing on a boring subway ride; your mileage may vary though as North American parents seem to think everyone around them is a potential child rapist).<p>It might feel strange at first, but the more you behave like a friendly approachable being the more people respond with the same. After all, most people, unless they are rather extroverted, are just like you, and are basically waiting for someone else to initiate contact with them.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2310340 href="vote?for=2310340&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%53%63%32%78%75%72%58%66%56%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2310340></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dustingetz">dustingetz</a> 331 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2310340">link</a></span></div><br>

Thanks, Daniel, for saying what I was thinking, far better than I could have.<p>I feel fortunate that my DNA is blessed with some sort of internal "governor".  I don't know where it came from, but I've always had it.  Here's how it works:  It stays out of the way when I am enthusiastic about something, allowing me work ridiculous hours and pursue almost anything that looks promising, whether it makes sense or not.  But when I reach a certain point, it turns me off, completely.  I don't seem to have conscious judgement of what that point is or when I reach it, but when it happens, I know.<p>A few examples:<p>- I have worked many times without sleep, preparing for a launch.  Sometimes, I know my judgement is failing and continuing would cause more problems in the long run.  So I stopped and apologize to everyone.  I went to sleep and informed everyone that the project would resume at x.  I'm not really sure exactly what happened, but I know I had little control over the governor.<p>- I had 2,500 invoices spread across the carpet, looking for a clue about a bug.  After 8 hours, everything was fuzzy.  So I just gathered up the invoices, filed them away, and went to sleep.  Three days later a lightbulb went off, I spread out 100 of the invoices, and found the problem in 15 minutes.  I know that if I had continued that night, I never would have found the problem.<p>- I worked 90 hours per week for 2 months for a big deployment.  Without telling me, my co-founder spent all of our reserves travelling to a customer site to oversee the install.  He emailed me every 20 minutes with a problem.  Between being pissed off at him and exhausted from working on the wrong things, I realized the project was going nowhere and would never succeed.  So I just stopped working completely.  I went to bed and didn't answer email for 4 days.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I've encountered something similar to your "invoices" situation many times.  I'm actually blocked on something now, but I know my mind is hard at work to get things straight in some background process.  Once my block is cleared, I know I'll just dive in and get things done in the same amount of time it would have originally taken, only with better results.  I know that, because that's how it's worked for me so many times before.  Every once in a while I forget what I was working on, but it's usually in  favor of a better project or solution.<p>Fortunately, my blocks are usually short and resolved by letting my background processes chew on a problem during a night of sleep.<p>I think the real trick is to actually attack problems that cause me to block.  If I stick with simple things I can process in real time, I'm not thinking hard enough.<p>Of course, this sort of discussion here wouldn't be complete without a reference to good and bad procrastination:

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>...if you add up the number of hours that I've spent in conversation with editors, compilers and debuggers over the years...</i><p>I'm afraid to do that.  I would probably be shocked by the number, and then would quickly calculate my lifetime rate, which would probably be about 28 cents per hour.  This is the thing non-programmers never understand; programming takes <i>a lot of time</i>.<p><i>It's like a drug.</i><p>Great analogy!  For me, there's no bigger high than the exact moment of the conclusion of this process:<p>NothingThere + IDidSomething = SomethingThereForTheFirstTimeEver!<p><i>That process, the act of programming is something that I need to do.</i><p>Sometimes I think this is the difficult-to-define missing requirement for software success.  Some call it "passion".  Some call it "determination".  I call it "I can't imagine doing anything else".<p><i>but it has all the components of a 'real' program, input, computation, output.</i><p>Don't forget storage.  That was the killer feature that got me hooked.  You could write a simple program, store the result (on a disk!), come back later and build upon that result.  Before disk storage, computers were toys.  After disk storage, they changed the world.<p><i>there is nothing that can't be learned.</i><p>I've never had a tatoo, but if I did, this probably would be it (backward, on my forehead).<p><i>...all you need to be is a little bit better than you were yesterday and to keep doing that for a long time.</i><p>This advice:<p>1. is excellent.  Maybe the best you'll ever read here.<p>2. is <i>not</i> intuitive.  Most people don't get it.  Like compound interest, it's hard to wrap a human brain around it.<p>3. is universal.  It applies to almost anything you can do.<p>4. is very difficult to teach.  As soon as you think people get it, they don't.  They stop measuring their own deltas and resume comparing to perfection.  Grrrrr.<p>5. the single most important thing I've ever programmed in business turn-arounds.  The best dashboards and report writers I've ever written are time-phased; they clearly show improvement <i>over time</i>, which is almost always more important than any snapshot:<p>Losing + Improvement + Time = Winning<p><i>Beware of that bug though, once it bites you, you'll be hooked for life.</i><p>To this day, whenever I need something for myself and can't find it in 5 minutes, I build it.  It may not be the most effective way, but I just can't help myself.  There must be a (3)(2)(2) program for people like me.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2291722 href="vote?for=2291722&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%53%63%32%78%75%72%58%66%56%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2291722></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=edw519">edw519</a> 336 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2291722">link</a> | <a href="item?id=2291534">parent</a> | on: <a href="item?id=2291534">Forty-five times faster at programming</a></span></div><br>

If you've really found good use for tools like these, then your project is probably too big.  Break it down into smaller pieces, build a prototype for each piece, get feedback, and refine.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Engineering blueprints <i>are</i> the "code".  They are intended to be read in a systematic manner by someone who can put the parts together.  In software, we call that someone a compiler.<p>Design documents, such as sketches, artists renderings, specifications of performance, etc., may or may not be useful to the engineer producing the blueprint.  The discussion of UML is at the level of these artifacts.  If UML is useful, I want to look at it and have an idea of what the software is going to do.  Some parts, like event-state diagrams, activity diagrams, and use cases, are pretty good at capturing that design in a way that I can talk about it with someone who doesn't understand code.  I would not pay someone for completing a document like that, though, not until it was reflected in code.<p>Another way of capturing design is through functional tests.  Look at projects like Fit for examples of how that might work.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2293001 href="vote?for=2293001&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%53%63%32%78%75%72%58%66%56%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2293001></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=shushan">shushan</a> 335 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2293001">link</a></span></div><br>
