<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It sure looks like you've been through quite a bit and, at the very least, deserve some brutally honest feedback from this community.<p>Many may not agree with me and this may not make you feel much better, but after reading your experience, quite a few thoughts came to my mind. In no particular order:<p><i>I kinda knew it was going to happen</i><p>What? That's a horrible attitude and probably a self-fulfilling prophesy. I know of many cases (mine included) where everything was "perfect", world-changing idea, solid team, great skill, intense passion, practically a perfect alignment of the stars, and it <i>still failed</i>. Software is hard! Startups are harder! You will probably fail anyway, so if you attitude isn't 100%, then you should save yourselves and everyone else a lot of trouble and not even bother.<p><i>truly believed that my current startup had potential to grow</i><p>See my remarks above. You may have been right about your startup's potential and still failed. This is normal!<p><i>I lost the one chance I had</i><p>This is ridiculous so just get it out of your head. We all get <i>many</i> chances. Many successful entrepreneurs failed (several times) before they succeeded.<p><i>Given that we didn't have any programming or design experience</i><p>Then I'm not surprised you failed. Those of us with lots of experience, myself included, are constantly encouraging those with little or no experience to pursue building virtual stuff. It's a wonderful avocation with great opportunity for career satisfaction. But please don't mistake encouragement for approval. You will have to pay your dues first. Sure, it's much easier to come up to speed quickly now than it used to be, but you still have to get <i>something</i> under your belt before you can build good stuff. Like I said earlier, it's tough enough for the best of us to succeed with a startup; by definition, it's tougher for you.<p><i>One of the startup advice that I hear most often is to create a product that solves a problem of your own (37signals) because there's bound to be people like you who have the same problem.</i><p>There's no guarantee of that. Worse, lots of others may be thinking the same thing, so we end up with lots of teams building the same useless thing that they all want but no one else does. Or others may want, but not badly enough to pay. It's interesting advice that has been effective for some people, but frankly, I've never liked it. As a natural outlier, I would <i>never</i> build something that I want. For me, that's just a recipe for failure. I'd much rather pound the pavement and find out what others want and are willing to pay for.<p>Please take this advice, like all advice on Hacker News, 37 Signals, or anywhere else with a grain of salt. Our industry is still in its infancy so there are few rules yet, just lots of guidelines. One of the best skills you can have now is to be able to distinguinguish between which advice is good or bad <i>for you</i>.<p><i>we sacrificed all the time we had with friends, family, and ignored our relationships for the most part</i><p>First of all, that's a bad attitude. Life is a zero-sum game, so by definition, you can't have it all. Using the word "sacrificed" to describe the thing you choose not to have is problematic. You chose A and didn't choose B. Fine. But you sacrificed nothing. In fact, you're probably way ahead. You learned stuff that most others never do, and the people who really matter are still there. By definition, you can't possibly lose real friends by living your life the way you choose. Anyone you lost was never really a friend in the first place.<p><i>It was miserable and lonely</i><p>Then you're in the wrong business. I spend 90% of my time alone with my computer and I love it! I have figured out how to balance work and life, but make no mistake about it, if you choose to be a programmer, and especially if you choose to start a startup, you will be alone with your ones a zeros a lot. If that doesn't absolutely turn you on, then maybe you should consider doing something else.<p><i>still dreaming of get rich quick schemes</i><p>Fuck. That. Shit.<p>If you're doing this to get rich, then please just stop and go do something else. Law school, medical school, Wall Street, selling ebooks, whatever.<p>I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but in order to succeed with software (and software startups), you must focus on many more things before money. First, you must absolutely love what you do. If you don't, then you will end up writing posts like yours. Then you must have an undying determination to build that which must be built (according to you). Anything less is a sure recipe for failure.<p>Sure, lots of us get rich but many more don't. And those that do often observe that even though they did the absolute best that they could, the real riches came from sources beyond their control: they got lucky or were in the right place at the right time.<p>There are lots of great reasons for building the stuff we build. IMHO, "getting rich" is not one of them.<p><i>That was the key- it would really tackle the problem of not being able to meet people and just socialize</i><p>It sounds like you may have gotten feedback in an echo chamber; that is, you talked to alot of similar people so you <i>thought</i> you had a random sample but really didn't. Frankly, the idea of using technology to accomplish that which is better done without technology (meeting people and not being lonely) is not appealing at all to me. (Previous disclaimer: I am an outlier, so I understand that I may be in the minority.)<p><i>This was a terrible mistake that we should've caught on.</i><p>Never say "should've". It's not possible to "should've". Now you know. It may not seem that way right now, but that's actually a <i>good</i> thing.<p><i>...this was something I had truly believed it, I truly worked hard for and believed that it wasn't just something stupid I created again on a whim.</i><p>It was not stupid and was not done on a whim. If it was you wouldn't have gotten as far as you did.<p><i>We tried to follow every piece of advice we were given...</i><p>Advice is input. Not all input should be processed.<p><i>...just had to let out some anger.</i><p>Good! Now relax and listen...<p>You probably won't believe me now, so come back and read this in 30 days...<p>You are actually in great shape! You have learned things that most people in our industry <i>never</i> learn. Like Edison, you know x ways to <i>not</i> do a startup. So relax, regroup, do something else to feel better for a while, then when you think the time is right, do it again. Use all that you learned to go again without making the same mistakes. There will never be any guarantees, but you should feel confident you will be much better next time.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3439970 href="vote?for=3439970&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3439970></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=adriand">adriand</a> 28 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3439970">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Wow! This sounds incredible! Exactly the kind of thing that would be perfect for someone like me. A little background...<p>I'm one of those rare programming animals with a foot in each world.<p>I have written over a million lines of code and implemented many fairly sophisticated applications in over 90 different companies. So I have a great deal of confidence in my ability to build stuff. But here's the rub: most of the technologies I know so well are old (some may even say obsolete). So I have done what any self-respecting programmer would have done: I have taken upon myself to learn new technologies on my own and implement what I can where I can.<p>But there is so much demand for my services in the "old" technologies, it's hard to throw the switch. After spending all day on a client's project, it's tough to get enough momentum on my own stuff.<p>Also, I feel like I can really hold my own in areas in which I'm proficient. But technologies change so quickly, there are so many important things I feel weak in. Too weak to use on a client's work yet important enough to use when building new stuff. Also, I have never had any formal computer science education; I've learned everything I know in the school of hard knocks.<p>The idea of spending 3 months full time in the company of like-minded souls building cool stuff with new technologies and learning together is practically orgasmic for someone like me. (I know, I'm pathetic.) This would be the opportunity to "catch up" in all the things I've been wanting to do in an intense 3 month period. I can already think of a dozen projects I'd like to try in the class.<p>A few questions:<p>- How hard would it be to maintain a 30 to 40 hour client workload while going through the program? (And still have the energy to get all I want out of it.) I already work remotely and pretty much set my own hours. I do not want to stop my current work because people depend on me and I like the steady income.<p>- Do I sound like the kind of person who would do well in your program or are you seeking a more junior demographic?<p>- How hard would it be to get a reasonable room in NYC while maintaining a home elsewhere? (February 13 is way too soon for someone like me to relocate.)<p>- When will the next (after the Feb 13) session be? (That may be the best answer to my first 2 questions.)<p>It sounds like you guys are doing a great thing. Off the top of my head, I can think of dozens of my contempories that would blossom in a program like this. Best wishes for great success!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3435557 href="vote?for=3435557&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3435557></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nicholasjbs">nicholasjbs</a> 29 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3435557">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thanks for the kind words!<p><i>How hard would it be to maintain a 30 to 40 hour client workload while going through the program? (And still have the energy to get all I want out of it.)</i><p>I think this would be extremely hard (at least, I know it would be for me). We've had couple people hold down substantial client work (more on the order of 20-30 hours a week, I think) while doing Hacker School and make it work (and still get a ton out of it), but we've also had a couple that tried this and quickly realized they had to leave the program.<p><i>How hard would it be to get a reasonable room in NYC while maintaining a home elsewhere?</i><p>This is perfectly doable logistically. The biggest obstacle is the financial burden of paying two rents (or rent + mortgage). You can get a room in the city for ~$600-900/month. NYC has a crazy housing market but there are so many people here there's always stuff opening up and turning over, so it's easier to find a sublet for a few months here than, say, in Mountain View (I tried doing that and it was a mess).<p><i>When will the next (after the Feb 13) session be?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>We've had couple people hold down substantial client work (more on the order of 20-30 hours a week, I think)</i><p>I was typically able to get in 20-24 hours a week while in HS batch[1], so it <i>is</i> possible to do HS and client work at the same time, but it's very challenging.  I came in with two clients but wound up passing one of the projects off to another developer because it was too much work.  The other client I still work for.  Having two clients while in HS was completely impossible.  Having one client while in HS is doable, but it depends on the quality of the client.  The client that I kept never bothered me about trivial matters, gave me full autonomy over my work, provided the resources I needed to get the job done, and were just plain cool.  I still work for them.  If my description sounds nothing like any of your clients, I wouldn't recommend doing HS and client work simultaneously.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3436373 href="vote?for=3436373&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3436373></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=larrys">larrys</a> 29 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3436373">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"After spending all day on a client's project, it's tough to get enough momentum on my own stuff."<p>"How hard would it be to maintain a 30 to 40 hour client workload"<p>One thing that I learned early on (which forced me to sell my first company before pursuing another opportunity) was that you have much more time than you have energy. Which is essentially what you are saying. The distractions of day to day things takes away from creativity and drive.<p>On the plus side you will be in a completely new environment which I think is essential to even having a chance of making this work. The fact that the school is essentially full time 4 days a week will allow you to work the other 3 days, say 10 hours per day. So that is the decision you have to make. Do you feel you can work 7 days a week for the time period of the program.<p>Keep in mind though that  once you have completed the program you will still have to find the time to keep up your skills in whatever you have learned and you will still have the pressing needs of your current customers as well as the handcuffs of the income that they provide. That's going to be difficult to transition off of in my opinion.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3434630 href="vote?for=3434630&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3434630></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=edw519">edw519</a> 30 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3434630">link</a> | <a href="item?id=3434399">parent</a> | on: <a href="item?id=3434399">Quick Salary Tip for Software Engineers </a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; There's research that shows that in certain situations, the first mentioned number acts as a strong anchor. So you might want to be the first.<p>I believe I read the same research (Robert Cialdini? though he might have been citing other people's work).<p>The effect is certainly real, but the keyword here is "certain situations", I don't quite recall this research to include salary negotiations among these certain situations.<p>Though I'd love to be proven wrong, do you have a citation?<p>But let's say it works (I could easily be wrong on the above), this number anchoring effect also works when the number mentioned is not strictly related to the quantity you're trying to make higher (or lower) in the response. So you could passingly mention an hourly rate (or yearly income) of an unrelated profession, or even something like "activity/service X costs 90k yearly". In this case you can also safely name a much higher number than you're aiming for (as long as it's on the same order of magnitude, I suppose), which was shown to strengthen the anchoring effect. That way, you're still framing the "bigness" but without mentioning a possible salary first. So you get to have your cake and eat it too.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3435859 href="vote?for=3435859&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3435859></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ricardobeat">ricardobeat</a> 29 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3435859">link</a></span></div><br>

What do you do with your portfolio of "hacky" code?<p>For instance, recently I wanted to experiment porting an open source application to iOS, to give the old iPhone 3G I had just lying around a new life. There were certain parts of the existing codebase that weren't well structured to meet the requirements of the iOS APIs I had to fit in, but I managed to squeeze in the changes without any major restructuring.<p>It is code I am not proud of, code I would never write in a professional setting, but it was the perfect direction for my requirements and constraints. For that, I am really happy with the result.<p>Ultimately, I determined that the 3G just didn't have enough processing power to meet the expectations I had, so I don't have any interest in taking the project further or cleaning up the mess I made. However, even in the state it is in, it is code that is most likely useful to others.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It helps if they know you're looking elsewhere and getting other offers.  One of the jobs I ended up being really happy with made what I thought was a great offer to begin with, but I wanted to think things over.  I had 7 days to accept the offer and planned on using that time to be sure it's what I wanted to do.  Three days in they came back with an offer 10% higher if I accepted that day and halted the rest of my interviews.  I thought it over for a bit and accepted 10 minutes later.<p>Incidentally, I had a very good recruiter who was in communication with them.<p>If you don't have a recruiter, use that to your advantage.  A recruiter is probably going to get 25 - 33% of your base salary for commission.  The company is saving a lot of money hiring you without paying a recruiter fee.  That's why you see referrals as high as $10k -- it's substantially less than a recruiter fee.<p>And my final tip is to consider the overall compensation package and let your potential employer know that.  Salary is only one part of it.  I wouldn't even negotiate lower pay if they cover health care, because plans change annually, but I would argue for higher pay if their health plan sucks.  That sort of thing.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3434682 href="vote?for=3434682&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3434682></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ams6110">ams6110</a> 30 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3434682">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>How should I be evaluating myself?</i><p>The only metric that matters is the delta between what you know and what you need to know to build what you have to build. How do you find out what this is? By building that which must be built. When you get stuck, you will have to find a way to get unstuck: by getting educated, by consulting others, by finding others' solutions, or just by old fashioned figuring it out.<p><i>How often?</i><p>Continuously.<p><i>How should I decide what to work on?</i><p>Work on what needs to be worked on, not what you need to get better at. Any other approach would be backwards.<p>By definition, the "Competency Matrix" you cite is a bad goal. Every entry has different level of importance for every person and every situation. By trying to aspire to this flawed ideal, you will be wasting time on things that aren't important and missing things that are.<p>(Aside: When I reviewed the Competency Matrix, I had to laugh. Many of the items were so important that you couldn't help getting better at them just by building lots of stuff. And many will never be important at all.)<p>The best way to get good at what you should be getting good at is to build what needs to be built. Then trust the process and yourself to fill in the gaps.<p><i>Does my ability relative to others matter?</i><p>No! There will always be many people better than you. There will always be many people worse than you. You will probably be the best at something (or some combination of skills). You will probably never get very good at something (or some combination of skills). And you know what? It doesn't matter!<p>All that matters is whether or not you can successfully build that which must be built. The ability to figure out what that is and how to do that is the most important skill of all.<p>Moral of the story: Go find out what people need. Then build it. The more you become concerned with their needs and the less about your own, the sooner you'll take care of both.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3433960 href="vote?for=3433960&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3433960></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=feral">feral</a> 30 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3433960">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Lets say someone is just starting their tennis training. They like the game, but they want to learn how to play well.
Would you tell them that all that matters is whether they manage to beat their next opponent, and to focus on that?<p>Or might you say "Dont worry about whether you win or lose for a while, instead focus on improving your fundamental skills"?<p>The first strategy, where you only learn whatever you need to to achieve the next immediate goal, is a bit like greedy optimisation.
Its got its merits; but its also got its flaws - for example, you could pick up bad habits that help you win your first few games, but then hinder your later development.<p>Most teaching of advanced topics, which typically happens at university, seem to focus on building a broad foundation of theory, and move on to applications later; the whole idea underpinning this is that we can learn more efficiently than by just having people focus on solving the next problem they have.<p>I would advocate planning ahead, to try and find efficient paths through the space of programmer knowledge.
Hence I disagree with edw519's advice - if you are on a mission to improve your general programming, I think you are starting in the right place, by evaluating where you are, and trying to figure out whats most efficient to learn.<p>There is merit to grounding learning in solving real problems; but there's merit to trying to think ahead, and anticipate, too.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3434475 href="vote?for=3434475&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3434475></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=billpatrianakos">billpatrianakos</a> 30 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3434475">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Tennis and programming = bad analogy. When you program you have to know far more than just how to make the code work. You're usually learning at least 3 languages to get one program working, you have to understand the interactions between your program and the server or the OS and the hardware that your software will run on, then you get into maybe learning how certain compilers work, your IDE and other tools, frameworks, object oriented or functional style, etc. On top of that everything is constantly changing on you.<p>In tennis you have a set of unchanging rules. The equipment may advance slightly over the years but they're basically the same. So you really in tennis you learn the rules, strategies, equipment, and you're good. You could program all your life and not even scratch the surface of it all. That's why I think edw's advice is totally perfect. Learning by finding out how to get a task done is the way to go because you could learn all sorts of programming related stuff all day that you never use. In tennis you're far more likely to get an opportunity to use all you've learned.<p>Nice try with the tennis, it's a good argument but it doesn't work out in the end.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3434644 href="vote?for=3434644&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3434644></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=feral">feral</a> 30 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3434644">link</a></span></div><br>

This means you can set realistic deadlines for projects and meet them consistently. You must be a good motivator.<p>2.Show me you are intelligent. I will ask you questions to discern how in touch you are with todays market. I don't care if you've interviewed a dozen people for this job, I want to know if you've actually read my resume.<p>3.Show me how I fit into your vision. Truthfully, we’ll work best together if you sincerely think I am the best person for this job in the long run. I want to know how you can help me succeed in my career, Tell me.<p>4.Be highly skilled. If your job advert says that you need a highly skilled Developer then don't have me sitting in a corner refactoring shitty code for the first 6 months.<p>5.Be Passionate.

But how would you even know that if you don't hire them?</i><p>gets to the heart why they cant. 10Xers are not a technology they are personality and a attitude. Hell some of them are not ever that great at some of the technologies they use, but they know how to use the parts they need to get them to the finish line. They know the principles of elegance in clean code, and simple systems  that are only as complex as they need to be.<p>These people are not showing up to the door of people that interview like the author, and if they do they are not taking the position and probably recommending to other 10Xers to go ahead and avoid the interview.<p>I get the feeling from reading the article, that the author has not learned how to spot technical talent and is growing frustrated with it.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3431775 href="vote?for=3431775&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3431775></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=foolinator">foolinator</a> 30 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3431775">link</a></span></div><br>

  - It's to stop people from stealing other peoples' stuff.
  - There are strong opinions on both sides.
  - The old companies I love (movies, etc.) support it.
  - The Chamber of Commerce (mother, apple pie) supports it.
  - This young guy was very articulate; I like him.
  - I don't understand the Constitutional argument.
  - He says this new stuff wouldn't have happened. So what?
  - What is reddit?
  - I thought Facebook was for kids.
  - Who is Louie CK? I really don't understand what he did.
  - Why is the internet so afraid of ethical behavior?
</code></pre>
There is another comment in this thread by squeee which is the first one I read that my Uncle Art would understand, something like, "If someone shoplifts in your store, this bill allows the government to shut down your store." I could just picture my uncle raising holy hell if that ever happened.<p>I read the comments in this thread before I watched the video (like I usually do), so I was waiting for Alexis to say something like squeee said. Something that would get the great mass of those who don't understand the argument to take notice and take action.<p>Alexis, keep up the good fight. And find a way to get our aunts, uncles, and grandparents to "get it". I believe that will be the turning point of the battle.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3426418 href="vote?for=3426418&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3426418></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=DevX101">DevX101</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3426418">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Despite my differences with much of the Republican party platform, one thing that they are damn good at and I respect them for is an ability to communicate with their target base.<p>Where's there's a hot topic issue, the Republicans will come out in lockstep with voices on the same wavelength.  They use clear and simple language with a single antagonist.  In the really big battles they even coin phrases like 'Obamacare', 'Death tax', &#38; 'energy exploration', that succinctly convey their point of view.  Each of those phrases will be used repeatedly by every Republican on TV, until their opponents (Democrats) even adopt the same language they've invented.<p>This why I like that 'shoplifter in the store' analogy.  Its pretty simple and relatable to just about anyone.  On the topic of language though, the opponents of SOPA should be creating their own word/phrase.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>'Monopoly' is a good one too. I don't think the terms are mutually exclusive:<p>"They want the Government to create a Prohibition so they can have a Monopoly on content"<p>That said, I do think 'Prohibition' is an accurate description. SOPA may well be the first step in a 'War on Piracy' that does have strong parallels with '20s prohibition and the drug war. SOPA is a futile attempt to stop normal human behavior - sharing of content. It won't work. The fact that it won't work could lead to even more draconian blocking measures, creating a self-reinforcing loop of ever-escalating restrictions and punishments. 'Prohibition' conveys that futility and extremeness pretty well for a single term.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3426554 href="vote?for=3426554&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3426554></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=TobiasCassell">TobiasCassell</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3426554">link</a></span></div><br>

George Lakoff beautifully explains how they do this in his book- "Don't Think of an Elephant!: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate".. You also mention they get the other political parties to use "their" terminology as well, George Lakoff goes through this in the book as well. I found a ton of communication lessons in the book, and I dont think the tone will alienate anyone, even though its clear the author doesn't lean too far to the right.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I agree with you to some extent. However, one of the problems with how the Republican party communicates is that, amomg their target base, they will often conflate "memorizing and regurgitating" talking points with understanding/groking the issues. They may not know why they don't like Obamacare, but they can memorize that catchy word and they know it spells trouble.  But later when/if their party decides to change positions on the issue, a new catchy term with a positive connotation is coined for the masses to latch onto.<p>I think this runs at odds with what some people are trying to do, which is educate the electorate on why this <i>kind</i> of thing is a bad idea so that these types of issue branding tricks can't get past the public.<p>All that being said, I'm not sure that much of the electorate <i>can</i> be educated in this way, which probably does account for the success of this sort of thing.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3429306 href="vote?for=3429306&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3429306></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jberryman">jberryman</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3429306">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I don't think it's a correct analogy, since the copyright infringer isn't doing any possible (or perceived) damage to Disney. I think the pattern should be: "Company X gets shut down because one of its customers broke Law Y at the expense of Company Z".<p>And the best Company X I can think of is a sports franchise. (A customer base that is too large to monitor in real time, and that forms a community that would get shut down along with the business.) So what are Y and Z? I don't think they even have to differ from the reality. "Imagine if the government shut down the Boston Red Sox because one of its fans was handing out ripped Beyonce CDs."

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Unfortunately, while you may stumble upon an analogy that describes what could happen to some "poor business", they will all be disingenuous because your analogy leaves out the scenarios that Uncle Art would probably want to see action taken on.<p>What is happening in many cases is the Boston Red Sox gave the guy selling the Rolexes a booth to sell them in, and directed people searching for "Rolexes" to his booth.  The Red Sox hung up ads along the way and made money from all the people who walked past those ads on their way to get Rolexes.  Someone reported those Rolexes stolen, so the Red Sox kicked the guy out with no penalty to the guy or the Red Sox, and then let some other fake watch seller setup shop in the same booth.  This kept happening for years, and Rolex had to lay off 4000 people, while the Red Sox made a killing.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3428056 href="vote?for=3428056&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3428056></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=samwillis">samwillis</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3428056">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Hey, what about this?<p>I think a very accurate, yet simple metaphor would be something like:<p>Imagine this: If a man sings a Lady Gaga song in a park, then Universal Music Group will be able to close the park.<p>(Turn it into:  "If a girl sings a Lady Gaga song in her school, then Universal Music Group might ask to close the school."   and you may win every mother's support =P )<p>Or also:  If a thief tells someone where he left a stolen wallet, government may close the buidling where the talk took place.<p>PS: Hi everyone, I'm from Argentina, but I really care about SOPA because it may set a very bad precedent in Internet legislation. Right now, in a lot of countries, this kind of bill would make the proponent look like someone come from Iranian or Chinese government. A fascist person looking for a way to censor the Internet. But if this bill passes, a GLOBAL consequence will be that politicians in other countries (like Argentina, in my case) will say: "Look, this law was approved in the USA. And they care about Freedom of  Speach, so, it's not a big deal. -End of story-". And of course, they will use laws like this, to censor much more than just piracy. I dont want to sound fatalistic, but if this bill passes... well, we can start saying goodbye to the Internet as we know it.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3427357 href="vote?for=3427357&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3427357></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=foxylad">foxylad</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3427357">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; However, imo, a better approach to win public support would be to come up with specific solutions for the copyright problem and also acknowledge that copyright holders do have some legitimate concerns.<p>The types of solutions that are possible are the types they are least inclined accept.  Piracy is not killable without taking away the ability to communicate privately and probably not even then.  Soviet attempts merely lead to Samizdat, in spite of going to extreme lengths to track people down.  Also, prior to the internet, copyright infringement was widespread over sneakernet.  Attempts to control that via technical means merely taught a generation of kids how to crack software.<p>That's not to say there are no solutions.  William Patry has a new book about copyright reform.  There are new ways of doing business.  For example, iTunes proved successful, in spite of the fact that anyone who wanted to could have downloaded the same songs for free.  None of those things are stuff they want to hear, though.  They don't want to change.  They don't think they should have to change.  But reality has the last word and reality has no qualms about being unfair.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3428504 href="vote?for=3428504&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3428504></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=atlantic">atlantic</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3428504">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Why not take a more radical approach, and deny that there is a copyright problem. The supposed losses of the entertainment industry are all based on the argument that whatever is downloaded is lost revenue. In fact revenue should be compared to sampling - you try out a lot of stuff, and only buy the best. But you do buy. I download hundreds of e-books that are not locally available in bookstores, I browse through them, and purchase the best ones through Amazon. I do a lot more buying than if I did no downloading, so it's a net gain for the publishing industry.<p>Now, the evidence points to the fact that downloaders are also the biggest buyers of CDs and DVDs. If you look at it that way, there have been no lost revenues, and in fact the entertainment industry has benefited immensely from free downloading, which has helped it to reach a much broader market.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3428178 href="vote?for=3428178&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3428178></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=o2sd">o2sd</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3428178">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Noam Chomsky once noted that the problem of the soundbite age is that some questions don't have simple answers that fit inside 30 seconds or 2 minutes.<p>The main problem with SOPA is that it is not possible to solve a market problem with legislation. Copyright infringement is a market problem, and markets are a lot more effective in delivering solutions than Governments. Consequently, SOPA will utterly fail to prevent copyright infringement, resulting in even MORE draconian laws sometime in the future.<p>Specific to the problem of music and film is that these markets are highly regulated oligopolies that use their market power to engage in price fixing. Unlike efficient markets, in which there are a range of different prices, the music and film markets only have two prices: Idiotically expensive and free (illegal).<p>Personally, I would LOVE to pay $1 per episode to watch my favourite HBO series at a time, and in a place of my own choosing. Sadly I cannot. Hence, I either don't watch it at all, or I obtain it by 'other' means. Monopolies/oligopolies only offer one price, and they are free to gouge their customers as long as they can prevent any competition in the market.<p>In other words, SOPA is NOT about preventing piracy (because that is a hopeless cause, much like the war on drugs), but about protecting the music and film industries illegal, anti-competitive price fixing practices (by way of preventing any other production/distribution of that type of media). Illegal price fixing is a small price that all Governments will gladly pay, as music and film support the propaganda/mythology creation industry of Government.<p>The simplest solution to prevent piracy would be to open the music and film markets to competition, but that is exactly what the RIAA and MPAA are trying to prevent.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3426723 href="vote?for=3426723&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3426723></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=trunnell">trunnell</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3426723">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I agree that the Mickey Mouse analogy is probably more accurate than the shop-lifting analogy but I can't help thinking that it sounds a bit frivolous and contrived on first listen (if you analyze it then it makes perfect sense, but soundbytes shouldn't need analysis).<p>The shoplifting analogy seems more immediate and straight-forward to me. I understand that the shoplifting analogy equates piracy with theft but the distinction isn't really all that relevant to SOPA. Uncle Art probably equates piracy with theft anyway, so why fight the battle on two fronts?<p>One final point on this, by indirectly conceding the piracy/theft point you're less likely to step out of alignment with Uncle Art thus making it easier for him to agree with everything else you say. :)<p>P.S. I know we're all probably focusing too much on that killer soundbyte but I do think it was the missing ingredient. :)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3427448 href="vote?for=3427448&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3427448></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dgeb">dgeb</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3427448">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The problem I have with the shoplifting analogy as presented is that someone unfamiliar with SOPA might conclude that the website at risk must also be the victim of the crime.  How about analogies to other crimes like stealing from another customer, assaulting another customer, etc.  What's ironic is that the bar/nightclub industry is effectively governed by such a law.  It seems that, when patrons decide to do bad things in a bar, the government can revoke the establishment's liquor license.  Even the number of police visits to an establishment due to customers' bad behavior has been used against the establishment.  While I might have sympathy for the government if the bartenders were encouraging drunkenness, few other establishments must worry about their own culpability when a customer does something bad on premises.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3426753 href="vote?for=3426753&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3426753></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=stock_toaster">stock_toaster</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3426753">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's a little more in depth than the shop lifting analogy.<p>I like to use the following: "A person tells the government that they saw a TV in the local pawn shop which is really theirs. They never asked the pawn shop owner for it back and they have no reason to suspect the pawn shop owner knows it is stolen. The government will then shut down the pawn shop without even talking to the owner first or having significant proof that the item was really stolen. Every phone book will be required to remove the pawn shop's phone number from it and maps will not be allowed to show the pawn shop. The pawn shop can then attempt to get their store back from the government but if it turns out that the item really was stolen then the government will not return it." In the analogy the pawn shop is a website, the owner of the item is the copyright holder, the item is copyrighted content, and the removal of the phone number and map info is dns-delisting and search-engine de-indexing.<p>I think the above analogy holds up fairly well and clearly demonstrates the ridiculous measures SOPA goes to. It's also much more easily understandable by non-tech-savvy people.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I disagree strongly, even after your edit. Revenue right now does not ipso facto translate to a better or more sustainable business. Google is a great example. They could plaster their front page with advertisements which could, quite possibly, generate more revenue right now. But they know that users having a good experience right now will bring them back tomorrow. So they put off some possible ad revenue in the hopes that their users are more likely to continue using their service.<p>The same thing could be said of any company. It is possible to drive too hard to make a sale and alienate your customer. Right now you may benefit. But later down the road you will probably develop a bad reputation.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3426086 href="vote?for=3426086&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3426086></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=swombat">swombat</a> 32 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3426086">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I don't mean it as condescending. Sales takes a lot of creativity and skill - but still, if you're hired by, say, Fogcreek software, to sell the Fogbugz product to enterprises, the product is known, the customer base is more or less clear, and the process to get them sold has probably been practiced hundreds of times before you're hired. There will always be unique quirks to every client, but compared to the levels of uncertainty of entrepreneurial sales, you could say that every sale is pretty much the same.<p>Making a sale still takes a lot of skill and effort - and, even more, it takes tenacity, and drive, and a very strong desire to actually close rather than spend months and months waiting for the client to make up their mind. Sure, you might lose some clients by pushing for the close (though with experience, you know which ones will respond to it), but at least it then frees up your time to pursue other prospects who can be sold more easily.<p>I don't think that makes salespeople inferior to programmers. These are two different kinds of jobs with two different sets of parameters. Programming is project-based work, where you aim somewhere and you go there and then you're done. Sales is process-based work, where you have an infinite pile of leads to go through (and if the leads run out, you go and generate more), and selling more today doesn't mean you sell have less to do tomorrow. I find the latter much more difficult to do.<p>To put a final nail in the idea that I look down on sales - both my girlfriend and my ex-girlfriend are salespeople. Not that that's why I dated them, or anything, but it'd be hard to be with them if I looked down on their profession ;-)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3425562 href="vote?for=3425562&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3425562></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tghw">tghw</a> 32 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3425562">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I disagree with your edit; with the quick adage that it's far easier and cheaper to retain a customer than create a new one. It sounds to me like Fog Creek has a mix between sales and account management (but so do a lot of companies that I've come across). If your sales team is also working in that account management role, retaining their clients should always be high priority even if those customers wont' be up for renewal / another contract for some time.<p>Moreover (and I'm reading between the lines a bit here) I think part of that statement is referring to sales people ignoring the "hard" sales and focusing only on the "easy" sales. "Are you ready to buy? No? Ok, I'll call again in 6 months" becomes, "Let's talk about your concerns so that maybe you'll buy in a month instead of 6."</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3425668 href="vote?for=3425668&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3425668></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=funkah">funkah</a> 32 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3425668">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Although you have a point, I think you take it too far. Many of the worst decisions I have seen salespeople make were based on the drive to get someone to buy <i>now</i> rather than, say, next week. They even knew that rushing things was going to be bad for the customer, but the salespeople's interests didn't align with the customer's.<p>If you pressure someone into a sale now and they decide to leave soon afterward — perhaps even demanding a refund or issuing a chargeback — you've probably lost them for at least a year, and then the company is worse off than if you hadn't made the sale at all. But if you take a little while to make sure you get it right, the lost week or month will get canceled out by how happy they are with what you've given them.<p>So you're absolutely right that, all other things being equal, a sale right now is better than a sale tomorrow. But all other things are not always equal, and if you try to force every peg you find into that round hole, you're just going to end up with a lot of broken pieces.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3425572 href="vote?for=3425572&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3425572></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=JoachimSchipper">JoachimSchipper</a> 32 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3425572">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>To me, the article is about 1 or 2 years too early. It provides great detail about all the pros and cons of judging the choice in advance, but no evidence that they made the right choice. Unless Spolsky is ready to start judging the performance of a sales team by some metric other than revenue.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3428316 href="vote?for=3428316&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3428316></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kokey">kokey</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3428316">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think it also depends on what stage a business is at.  I think if you are in an initial high growth period the emphasis should certainly be on the 'buy right now' customers, these are new customers trying out a new company or customers you are taking off a competitor.  I think commission structures are more appropriate during this phase, the business still needs to find what type of customer it works best with, and it needs to get a critical mass of these, and this is mostly a numbers game.<p>However, there is a point where you've reached a certain critical mass, where your happy customers market for you, where your own marketing and presence sells the company.  Like Fog Creek, which is now an established and known company.  At this point you will do better at growing your customer base through marketing instead of commission driven sales, where customer service to the existing customers will do the selling for you, and changing the pay structure of your sales people will align them better to this approach.  It also allows you to convert your customer base slowly to those you know will remain with you for longer.  I think you still need to keep statistics on sales performance, and deal with bad performers and promote good performers, but these should be closer to a bonus structure and work over longer timescales, like the rest of the staff.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3420952 href="vote?for=3420952&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4b%6c%67%37%6c%70%36%65%4f%47"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3420952></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=edw519">edw519</a> 33 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3420952">link</a> | <a href="item?id=3420789">parent</a> | on: <a href="item?id=3420203">Poll: As a freelancer, how much do you bill per ho...</a></span></div><br>
