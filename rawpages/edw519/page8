<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>From what I've seen, there's just no crossing the skill chasm as a software developer. You've either got it, or you don't. No amount of putting your nose to the grindstone will change that.</i><p>What a scary thought.  Good thing it's not true.<p>One of the many reasons I became a programmer was that the sky was the limit.  Still is.  Want to learn something new?  Learn it.  Want to build something cool?  Build it.  The only real limitations are your belief that you can do it and your willingness to perservere until you do.<p>We are not like basketball players or musicians or chess masters where only the extremely gifted (who also work hard) can rise to the top of their craft.  With few exceptions, we all can.<p>I didn't always think this way.  I had a college math professor who once said, "Many of my students are simply not suited for the sciences."  And I was stupid enough to  believe him!  In retrospect, his comment said more about his weakness as a teacher than anything about his students.<p>How do I know this?  Because I learned the hard way. When working with my first mentor, I was always too quick to blame someone else for their limitations slowing progress. Until he said, "So teach them!"  He believed that <i>almost</i> anyone can learn and get good at <i>almost</i> anything. This seemed counterintuitive but after a while, I was able to adopt this belief system, and it has made all the difference.<p>There are many reasons why so many programmers suck, but "not being able to cross the chasm" isn't one of them.  Just a few of the real reasons:<p><pre><code>  - They never learned right in the first place.
  - They never built anything of real substance.
  - They were a tiny cog in a machine and never saw the big picture.
  - They got pigeon-holed into a small area for a long time.
  - Other things in their life took over.
  - They had shitty teachers.
  - They had to build on top of pre-existing shit and couldn't do it right.
  - They were stuck in environments where excellence never mattered.
  - They went into management too soon.
  - They got trapped into old technologies and methodologies.
  - They made too much money to make a career u-turn.
  - They just didn't care enough.
  - &#60;add your own&#62;
  </code></pre>
My programming has always gotten better every year. Sometimes I read my old code and can't believe I wrote it. And I still have tons of room for improvement.<p>I'm firmly convinced that almost any of us can get better, much better.  And even become "elite", whatever that means. Please don't listen to anyone else who tells you otherwise.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2903584 href="vote?for=2903584&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2903584></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mquander">mquander</a> 170 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2903584">link</a></span></div><br>

Whereas the things "any idiot can do", like speaking English, are turning out to the things that computers have a really hard time doing.<p>In this sense, if programming is a "humanistic" field, it seems like many people and kinds of people can achieve excellence in it.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Many of these reasons are the same: inability to pivot and adapt to adverse circumstances. For example, you cited "they had to build on top of pre-existing shit and couldn't do it right" as a creator of bad programmers. You sound like a college student on this one, because this is the norm in the software industry. Every programmer (good and bad) has faced this one <i>several</i> times. The difference between bad and good programmers is that good programmers make the extra effort to learn the lessons that no one will explicitly teach them (i.e. figure out why the "pre-existing shit" got all fucked up in the first place) whereas bad programmers just accept it as-is or, worse yet, learn the wrong lessons and conclude that the pre-existing shit is how it should be (i.e. people who believe that C++ or Common Lisp, warts and all, are infallible languages, immune to reproach or change).<p>Having mentors, supportive management, and interesting work is great. But these are not the norm anywhere and they're certainly uncommon in the first few years in the software industry. A career average of 25% on these, for one's first 10 years, is probably about par. The good programmers are those who figured out how to get better in spite of these setbacks.<p>If I were going to put it into simple terms, the problem with the worst of the bad programmers (the deserving underclass) is that they don't expect much of themselves. They're happy to chug along at 100 lines/month on uninspiring work, and they do just enough not to get fired, but they don't achieve enough to offset the complexity load they create by modifying code while not knowing what they're doing, and by imposing resistance-to-change on the organization they inhabit. That's Class #1 of bad programmers, the ones who've been powerless for too long and are now just passing through. It probably comprises 65% of bad programmers out there.<p>Class #2 is the do-the-wrong-thing-well type. These are the ones who are generally very intelligent but narrow-minded. For example, they optimize for runtime performance at the expense of code readability, or who use the wrong languages, or who eschew databases because "SQL is a mess; let's just use the filesystem". They tend to be really, really good at some small subset of programming and tend to want to use that set of tools and skills even when not appropriate. These are the people who annotate an O(n^2) sorting algorithm as "WRONG!!" even when it's sorting a collection of 20 elements, because to them, not optimized == wrong. Their learning rates were too high, and now they're stuck at suboptimal local maxima. That's 15% of bad programmers.<p>Class #3 of bad programmer (15%) is the rock star, the kind who writes lots of code quickly, uses fancy "metaprogramming" features, but no one can understand the code (much less the rock star) a week after it's written. They tend to be parasitic, appearing highly productive but actually generating lots of unpleasant work (externalized costs) for the rest of the team. The call sign of the rockstar is the tendency to change interfaces willy-nilly and expect everyone else to adapt to his changes.<p>Those numbers add up to 95%. I'm going to leave 5% open to acknowledge that there are species of bad programmers I haven't met yet.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2905103 href="vote?for=2905103&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2905103></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=wging">wging</a> 170 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2905103">link</a></span></div><br>

There are plenty of psychological reasons why a person who is capable of doing something might think they have "zero talent", and it's perfectly plausible for a good mentor to help them unlock their ability.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Please don't make the mistake of assuming this discussion applies to you. The subject has nothing to do with honing one's programming skills. [Edit: oops, I confused this thread with another. Never mind, the real point follows.]<p>As for crises of confidence, what makes them tough is that they opportunistically seize on every item that floats through consciousness and turn it into some new weapon to batter you with. One thing I found helped is to give up on the idea of "talent" altogether and just focus on things that interest you and give you pleasure (edit: and best of all, have value to others) <i>whether or not you have any talent at all</i>.<p>Actually, someone who really lacked talent probably wouldn't feel the way you describe. They'd just drop out of the game and rationalize it as "that stuff sucks anyway". So you probably do have talent, but the state you're describing is not one that can accurately assess anything remotely related to the idea. In such a state, it can actually be creatively liberating to just redefine yourself as a fool and get on with it. It's like when you're sitting by a swimming pool enjoying the sun and someone starts splashing you with water. If you can't get them to stop, a good defense is to just jump in the pool.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2903728 href="vote?for=2903728&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2903728></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=spacemanaki">spacemanaki</a> 170 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2903728">link</a></span></div><br>

Want to build something cool? Build it. The only real limitations are your belief that you can do it and your willingness to perservere until you do.<p>That's not what he's saying.<p>He's divided the world into two peoples: those with the capacity to program and those who cannot regardless of effort.<p>These groups are often confused because people <i>can</i> program, but only may do so badly. Yet even being a poor programmer puts you in group A, and effort will make you a better programmer.<p>On the other hand, there are those who cannot program: cannot write a loop, cannot use variables, cannot create a working algorithm even with copy and paste.<p>The may perhaps be able to do simple math, but when it comes to composing equations or functions together into an interdependent process...they are simply unable.<p>They <i>may</i> try if they're so inclined to learn programming, but they'd die of old age before they can even begin to reach a standard that we'd call mediocre.<p>That is what he is say.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>True. And not. Continuing with the sports analogy I think the comparison of sprinters and marathon runners is an apt one. It's been found (<a href="http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/anatomyandphysiology/a/MuscleFiberType.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/anatomyandphysiology/a/Mu...</a>) that sprinters have a muscle metabolism that is much more anaerobic than normal <i>from birth</i> (you never exhale during a 100m dash), so good sprinters are pretty much born rather than made. On the other hand, although good genes do help (why are marathon winners generally from Africa?) you can train your muscles to have more efficient aerobic metabolism and be a top-notch marathoner.<p>So Gates is right in that top talent is probably born, there's <i>nothing</i> you can do to attain that level (which is true for most things, btw). But you can become a damn good programmer by practice.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2903686 href="vote?for=2903686&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2903686></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mattm">mattm</a> 170 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2903686">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'd like to agree but do you honestly believe someone like, say, Paris Hilton could become a good programmer?  Because unless I'm mistaken, it seems you are arguing for that.<p>I believe sometimes, some people, just aren't suited for a particular craft.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  It's a good thing that everyone has skills and interests in different areas.<p>To be a good programmer, there are a lot of pre-requisites one needs to learn first - skills such as a passion for self-learning, ability to think logically, ability to receive feedback and improve on that, etc. If someone begins as a programmer without these pre-reqs they will have a very difficult time getting to the stage where they can be a good developer.<p>I recently worked with a junior programmer that just wouldn't listen.  I would try to advise him but he would completely ignore it and just go back to copying and pasting code and hoping it would work.  Even walking through code line-by-line it was clear he had trouble understanding simple assignments.<p>Now, maybe that is my fault as a mentor but, IMO, he needed to first learn how to listen and receive feedback before he could move on to the next step.  Unfortunately, some people are just too stubborn and will not change.  For those people, I don't see how they could become great programmers.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2904165 href="vote?for=2904165&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2904165></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=lutorm">lutorm</a> 170 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2904165">link</a></span></div><br>

If you're working overtime very often on your own business, it's either because you're incompetent, or lazy, or greedy, or failing (see 'incompetent').

I guess many of those people fall into the "greedy" camp and are doing it for the money.  But I think most of them do it because they love (or are just addicted to) the game they are playing.<p>Whoever you're competing with, you've probably got competitors smarter than you and willing to put in long hours.  If you're playing to win (many people do, for a lot of reasons), how do you propose to beat them?<p>To anticipate a common argument: Yes, working hard can lead to stress/bad decisions/burnout.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's my understanding that when people say "working hard" in these discussions, they aren't comparing 25 hrs/week vs. 50 hrs/week.  They're usually comparing 50 hrs/week vs. 75 hrs/week.<p>If I forked my life into a version of me that worked 50 hour work weeks and one that worked 75 hour work weeks, the 50-hour me would win, hands down.  The 75 hour work week me would outright <i>miss</i> most of the key strategic decisions that got me where I am.  When I look at everything I've done that in hindsight has been a huge career boost - getting involved in the Harry Potter fandom, making friends on the C2 Wiki that got me a job in financial software, learning Lisp &#38; functional programming, founding a startup, and getting a job at Google - they <i>all</i> happened in the downtime between work.  Had I simply worked 75 hour work weeks since 2001, I would be a physics grad student right now, hating it, and making a pittance.  I'd probably be a damned good physics grad student, but that doesn't help me very much.<p>Now, I <i>also</i> put in quite a few hours into developing skills and building a track record, and I don't think those opportunities would've opened up if I hadn't.  But I wouldn't have thought to look for the opportunities if I did nothing but concentrate on work.  You're a big fan of necessary but not sufficient conditions, right?  The work is necessary, but so is the downtime.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2902856 href="vote?for=2902856&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2902856></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=marvin">marvin</a> 170 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2902856">link</a></span></div><br>

I've heard from many successful business founders that they often have no choice but to work long hours at the start. I know swombat is talking about <i>regular</i> long hours, but what is his definition of regular? There are always exceptions to the rule.<p>I don't have a lot of respect for people who make overly-general statements in absolutes.

I'm very much for people having a balanced life, and for treating employees fairly. However, depending on the situation, there may be periods where you do need to work long hours.

In fact, almost anyone, no matter their age and experience, is utterly incompetent at running their own business when they first get started.<p>I think your problem is that you're taking "incompetent" as a personal insult (not sure why you're doing that..) when it's meant as a statement of fact. I was certainly utterly incompetent when I started my first two businesses - and in fact I am still somewhat incompetent, as exemplified by the fact that I do need to work evenings and weekends every once in a while.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2902715 href="vote?for=2902715&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2902715></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tensor">tensor</a> 170 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2902715">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I assume when you say incompetent, you mean <i>lacking in experience</i>. That is correct, and often unavoidably so. Unfortunately, incompetent is typically used in a far more derogatory manner by most. Thus, I fear most people reading your post will take as a synonym for stupid.<p>But even with that clarified, I'll still disagree. The first 3-6 months of starting a business often involves a lot of busy work. This is not coding or otherwise requiring of immense thought, but it does take time. A great many business owners have said that it requires long hours to get a business up and running.<p>Of course, that does not apply to regular employees. Nor should it remain constant after you've started. Even so, heads of companies often do spend longer hours working than most. That's not to say their lives are unbalanced. Let me quote Bill Gates:<p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/30/news/newsmakers/gates_howiwork_fortune/" rel="nofollow">http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/30/news/newsmakers/gates_howiwo...</a><p>* It's a nice luxury to get some time to go write up my thoughts or follow up on meetings during the day. But sometimes that doesn't happen. So then it's great after the kids go to bed to be able to just sit at home and go through whatever e-mail I didn't get to. If the entire week is very busy, it's the weekend when I'll send the long, thoughtful pieces of e-mail. When people come in Monday morning, they'll see that I've been quite busy— they'll have a lot of e-mail.*<p>Working long hours is not <i>always</i> a sign of incompetence or lack of process. It still depends on the situation, and what you do in those hours. I do agree with a weaker statement, <i>it shouldn't be that the majority of your employees always have to work long hours</i>.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2901124 href="vote?for=2901124&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2901124></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rtc">rtc</a> 171 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2901124">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This is the fallacy of long hours. You spend so many hours at work every day and every once in a while you have some late night inspiration or collaborative breakthrough or take advantage of some other opportunity, and then like any gambling addict you associate working long hours with the rewards. You ignore all the costs (stress, family strain, sleep deprivation, lower productivity, higher defect rates, etc.) It's classic confirmation bias.<p>Add to that the machismo notions that working long hours is working "harder" than otherwise and that working fewer hours shows less commitment and less strength.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>From my conversations with I-banker friends, it sounds like the long hours in I-banking are externally imposed.  When a client is facing an imminent acquisition deal, it's very important that they get all their accounting straightened out, all their valuations nailed down while the acquirer is still interested.  A delay usually means the deal falls through.<p>So when companies come to an I-banking firm, they're usually like "I need all your best people on this, stat."  And because there're millions of dollars at stake, the I-banking firm will happily comply.<p>So I-bankers definitely fall into the "working late because of <i>somebody else's</i> incompetence" camp.  In this case, it's customers.  There're various things that startups could do that would make I-banker's jobs a lot easier: keep good accounting records, make sure they're completely covered legally, have solid revenue streams, don't get all buddy-buddy with potential acquirers.  But startups that do all this rarely need an I-banker to close the deal; they just negotiate directly with a potential acquirer, have the lawyers draw up a deal, and sign it.<p>Basically, the I-banking business model is trading other people's stupidity for cash.  It's the same thing with management consultants, and divorce attorneys, and litigators, all also professions that can make a lot of money but have shitty quality of life.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2900669 href="vote?for=2900669&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2900669></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=yrislerlhf">yrislerlhf</a> 171 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2900669">link</a></span></div><br>

Your role as a product developer is to understand the customer's underlying problem.<p>Discover what the <i>problem</i> is, and you might discover that they don't need a <i>Widget X</i>; maybe they need a <i>Feature X</i> or a <i>Gadget X</i>. Maybe it reveals holes in your training processes. Maybe they just revealed a seemingly trivial bug with existing stuff.

I don't even imagine why you are mentioning this.<p>I mentioned it because the products sparked a revival of the Apple brand in consumer's minds. But yeah, now you mention it, the technology did do a great job of scaling down to the phone. BeOS might have been fine too, but hey, Palm chose a Linux kernel instead.<p>We're discussing could-have-beens, which is pointless.<p>&#62; there was nothing super new about objective C. ever heard of smalltalk?<p>With that line of argument, there's been nothing new in computer languages for thirty years.<p>I'm sure you love your BeBox and spend your life porting stuff like Firefox to Haiku, but as cool as BeOS was <i>on the surface</i>, the world has past it by. Stop lamenting what could have been, there's no interesting arguments to be had there.<p>&#62; i just can't stand to see apple taking any underserved merit<p>Whereas giving too much credit to experimental failed projects like BeOS isn't?</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2889889 href="vote?for=2889889&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2889889></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=krevis">krevis</a> 173 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2889889">link</a></span></div><br>

&#62; If you cannot say that, I's say you failed.<p>Doesn't "not having plenty of time to spend with our family and friends" follows directly from not winding up at 5?<p>Regardless of what you consider a failure, the hard fact is most of the businesses demand time - a lot of time. And there are only so many hours in a day. For the starting days, putting up south of 12 hours is common, and that takes a toll on the time you would have spent with your near and dear ones.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2889147 href="vote?for=2889147&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2889147></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=palish">palish</a> 173 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2889147">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Bravo.  This looks like an excellent next step.  Not necessarily the ultimate scalar, but it's nice to see the vector pointing in the right direction.<p>As was one of the many outspoken people in one of the earlier threads, I hope I speak for a lot of my fellow hn'ers when I say that we call 'em as we see 'em, for better or worse.  Not necessarily in judgement, but as part of a community living through monumental changes of all kinds.  Believe it or not, Brian, many of us really are on your side.<p>Like many other "new age" business models, I'm afraid I still don't really understand this one and it's prospects for the future.  But it's safe to say you've just taken one giant step on that bumpy road to sustainability.<p>Two of the most important things I expect from any business is to always tell the truth and to always do the right thing.  It matters less how long you take to get there than the fact that you actually do.<p>Looking forward to seeing how this plays out.

Use any resources at your considerable disposal.<p>3. Help her find her irreplaceable stuff. A few private detectives and a small team of scouters can make more progress in 2 weeks that the SFPD can make in a lifetime. Publish pictures of her grandmother's jewelry to enlist a giant army of spotters.<p>4. Hire her and pay her well (perhaps even with equity). She is obviously an excellent writer and an empathetic persona. But more importantly, she is an expert in addressing what is clearly the weakest link in your business model's chain.<p>5. Fuck the business models, projections, and funding rounds and just "do the right thing".<p>This appears to be a royal fuck-up. But nothing compared to the lost goodwill for Airbnb, YC, the startup community, and the "new order" in general. Many of us had thought that you all had deprecated the era of Ford Pinto thinking. Current data appears to be to the contrary.<p>Turn this lemon into lemonade before the window closes. Tick. Tick. Tick.<p>[EDIT: This has nothing to do with assigning blame; this incident was clearly an outlier and nobody's fault (except the obvious bad guys). And it has nothing to do with solving this class of problem. All I'm saying is that fixing this instance will lead to solving this class. It presents an excellent opportunity to fix things in a way that never could have been imagined before.  Airbnb has a compelling business proposition with an obvious Achilles heel. This unfortunate situation presents an excellent opportunity to address that weakness head on.  But only with a 179 degree change in thinking.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I've just learned more about this situation, and it turns out Airbnb
has been offering to fix it, from the very beginning.  From the
beginning they offered to pay to get her a new place and new stuff,
and do whatever else she wanted.<p>The story Arrington wrote yesterday about Airbnb not offering to
help was bullshit.  He asked a company spokesman what Airbnb was doing to help her.  The spokesman, who'd been told by their
lawyers that he couldn't go into detail about that because of the
precedent said "I can't comment on that." So Arrington, in typical
Arrington fashion said "Well, unless you tell me I'm going to write
that you're not willing to do anything for her."  And he did.  Really
not cool.<p>I've talked to the Airbnb guys and they are already doing everything
they could be doing to help this woman.<p>Even if you don't believe they are nice guys (which they are, among
the nicest of all the people we've funded), do you really think
they are so dumb that they don't realize it's not worth the bad PR
to save money and effort in this situation?</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2822900 href="vote?for=2822900&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2822900></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=edw519">edw519</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2822900">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The thing is, Paul; I am fully willing to believe that TC are grabbing the sensational as best they can - and twisting the story. I more than believe the spokesman spoke in careful legal terms and inadvertently caused the fuckfest. I can totally get that we are getting tiny snippets of the story - even from EJ herself.<p><i>however</i><p>EJ has posted a blog in which she clearly feels upset, distraught, confused and worried.<p><i>Whether legitimately or not she doesn't feel happy.</i><p>This is the point where a big corporation goes into PR drive. But a startup and indie company such as Airbnb should, and <i>could</i>, be doing this:<p>* Fuck laywers, who cares about legal when a person is upset and distraught<p>* The Company is in SF - go and meet her tomorrow, forget the internet and the blog, make the person feel safe and cared for<p>* Pursue the culprits like the plague, hire a PI and pressure the police. Call in your big-guns contacts in SF and the Valley. Get millionaires calling the PD until they have a task force on the issue. After all; it is the reputation of the company at stake<p>* Take this girl on an apartment hunting spree, buy her something nice and replace the kit she lost.<p>And then tell the internet about it!<p>Ultimately there are two factors to consider here. Firstly her welfare, of course. After that it is OK to think of the company. If you can combine these two factors then no one is going to moan at them. Yes, the ideas I set out there are "above and beyond" - but we live in this shitty culture where everyone seems to have to consult lawyers when the shit hits the fan. Speaking for myself, if I heard about this issue (even if I heard about it after the first blog post went viral) my first response would not be to call the lawyers and see what I could say, it would be to call the damn girl, find out she was in the same city and turn up on the damn doorstep with a lawyer and a phonebook of people to ring and fix the issue.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>it turns out Airbnb has been offering to fix it, from the very beginning</i><p>No one really cares what Arrington wrote. Everyone knows Arrington's rep.<p>What people are upset about is how the blog post that Chesky wrote sounded like.  His post sounded like...<p>"Ummm...here are our security features..."<p>The correct public and private response is:<p>"This is a horrific.  This is unacceptable.  As CEO, I'm not going to rest until this is made right.  I've assigned 3 people to this problem to do whatever is necessary to make this right.<p>We are extremely concerned about this, and we have a lot of work to do to make sure something like this will never happen again. Safety is job 1."  Of course backing up those words with actions.<p>That way, even if the lady is lying. Even if it's a hoax...  Even if it's complete crap... it doesn't matter, because people know that you take this seriously, and you're pulling out all the stops.<p>If there's a follow up blog post that details more horror stories...  And, you have indeed made those phone calls.. then you say, "I'm really sorry that our response has been less than what you have needed or less than what you expected.  That's on me, (as CEO).  I will personally make this right.  Call this number, they will put you directly in contact with my cell phone.  and, I will make this right."  And, of course, backing up those words with actions.<p>That way, no one can accuse you of having a less than stellar response to this.  You are above reproach...<p>Because you've done the right thing for the person.  The right thing to do is to do the right thing for the person.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2824713 href="vote?for=2824713&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2824713></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=frossie">frossie</a> 190 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2824713">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Exactly. First, it doesn't matter if the AirBnB guys are nice or not - it wouldn't be the first time in the history of mankind that a nice guy did the wrong thing faced with a woman in distress.<p>The problem is that this woman sounds like everybody's friend/sister/cousin. She sounds totally believable, and her story taps into a fear that a reasonable person would have <i>a priori</i> with the AirBnB model ("what if I rent to a wacko?").<p>So there is zero point in nickel-and-diming her with whether it was 8 hours or 24 before she heard from them, whether the dude is in custody for this crime or another crime - <i>the point is that this story is now apocryphal</i>. There is no point arguing the facts - AirBnB must focus on  the concerns that every single person out there who read that story now has.<p>For the record: I live in a popular holiday destination, and yet dismissed listing on AirBnB when I first became aware of them because I have a child in the house, and did indeed think "what if I rent to some wacko, risking my own safety is one thing, risking my child's is another". If AirBnB want to move beyond the so-young-they-feel-immortal single set, they have to plausibly deal with these fears.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2822867 href="vote?for=2822867&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2822867></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=DanHulton">DanHulton</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2822867">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Excuse me for strongly disagreeing, but one doesn't need to know her to answer whether she's lying.<p>The facts of what AirBnB is, or is not, doing to date are known and demonstrable.<p>So far, and after far too much time has passed, only words and assurances have surfaced.  No one from AirBnB, nor you yourself, has mentioned any concrete assistance already provided directly to this AirBnB customer. In this very thread, the founder says, more or less, "We're here for you."  What has that meant so far?  What does it mean now?<p>Without knowing her, by seeing proof from AirBnB you <i>would</i> know if she is lying.  If you don't know, that would imply you haven't seen proof of concrete support to date.<p>I recently listed a property on AirBnB. AirBnB could make $8,500 a year from me in fees -- it's a nice property.  I'd hate to see it damaged.<p>You can see I have a high degree of interest in seeing how AirBnB handles customer service, to decide whether I should instead be using an old school Realtor™ or VRBO w/ manual listing and screening. I'm sure there are others thinking this same thing, and we early adopters talk. A lot.<p>Will AirBnB be like Nordstrom and Apple, or will it be like Chase Bank?  So far, I'm seeing inaction followed by hand-waving once word got out.  Let's see AirBnB's no-spin action approach if there is one.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2824631 href="vote?for=2824631&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2824631></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=SemanticFog">SemanticFog</a> 190 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2824631">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Someone's not telling us the whole story, and it's unclear whether that someone is the company or EJ. (Or maybe even the police).<p>Whatever the case, Airbnb increases its PR risk the more people it puts in contact with EJ. It should have assigned one person to talk to her, so as to keep the story straight and maintain a consistent line of communication with EJ. And that person should have been a founder / C-level exec from the get go.<p>You could argue that a co-founder's time, especially in the middle of a giant financing round, makes the opportunity cost too high. Nonsense. The opportunity cost of the PR hit, versus the potentially massive positive PR of a crisis turnaround, is nigh incalculable. Possibly even worth tens of millions in intangible value and impact on future growth.<p>Take a page from the old 1980s-1990s Disney playbook on crisis management. Whenever a big PR fiasco popped up at the theme parks -- which was often -- Michael Eisner was the face of the crisis management effort. Now, obviously Michael Eisner himself wasn't personally up all night working exclusively on the crisis in question. No doubt he had a team on the case, feeding him his talking points. But he was the single public face of the company in all communications related to the crisis. Not some PR flack, or some customer service rep. Not some vice president. The CEO himself. It counted for quite a lot, even at times when it was bullshit.<p>(Note, of course, that I would never advocate the use of bullshit, especially in the EJ case).</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2823033 href="vote?for=2823033&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2823033></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dlss">dlss</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2823033">link</a></span></div><br>

This mess take a long time to fix even in the best circumstance. So it is natural for EJ to still feel violated and frightened.

I'll be lot more piss off if the customer service is the only one to talk to me.<p>Airbnb does sound like they are doing their part. Although if they really do pressure EJ to take down her post it will be the dumbest thing to do.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Nobody cares about Arrington. That's not AirBnB's problem. AirBnB's problem is "EJ".<p><i>I've talked to the Airbnb guys and they are already doing everything they could be doing to help this woman.</i><p>If they've been offering to fix it from the start, why haven't they said that? Certainly the victim doesn't believe they've offered much, if anything at all... either that or you've just called her a liar. (I obviously have to allow this as a possibility - that this whole story is fake.)<p>They clearly need to talk to her more than they are though. Somebody in charge needs to pick up a phone. They need to convince her that it is no longer in her best interests to spout the gory details on her blog. That hasn't been done yet, clearly, so it's hard to say that they are doing everything they can.<p>I don't think people - at least from what I've read here - are questioning their integrity. People are questioning the optics of what seems to be a decision to defer to lawyers worried about an unknown future possibility rather than to do the right thing in this very real situation. That's what is causing the bad PR, not exaggerating reporters.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>PG - I can't believe I'm defending Arrington but it is hard to say that he's the one at fault here.<p>- Most of the damaging content is from EJ's blog. The original TC article only has a couple of bad parts where it says "Airbnb’s response so far has been tepid at best. It turns out that when something like this happens, Airbnb isn’t financially responsible." but that's arguably very fair editiorial opinion given EJ's reaction and the company spokesperson not revealing anything.<p>- TC has been good about airing the AirBnB side of the story - from Brian Chesky's guest post to updating their initial posts with comments from him.<p>- All the follow-up brouhaha has been caused by EJ's second post.

The upside here is that Airbnb was involved and it seems is trying to do whatever they can to help her, up to and including paying for a new place. Now that it's been revealed she is misrepresenting Airbnb's reaction and handling of her case in her latest post[1] it becomes hard to deny this "victim" is utilizing their situation, i.e. manipulating it.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62;  I don't see how a random blogger is more plausible than pg and Airbnb?<p>Yeah, that's status thinking and antithetical to rational discourse. You evaluate a story or its plausibility on _its_ merits, not on the status of who tells it (unless you have _real_ information about the author's credibility, which in this case neither of us, correct me if I'm wrong, have.)<p>&#62; this seems to corroborate pg's statement, they offered her financial support<p>No, it doesn't. There's a difference between "offering" support and giving it. What EJ said in her follow-up post is that although she was initially offered full support, none of it has actually materialized in the weeks after.<p>&#62; But I'm still inclined to believe pg would not spread disinformation; why should he? I think the man is much smarter than you're giving him credit for...<p>Maybe you should get your nose out of pg's behind and realize that pg too puts his shoes on one at a time and shits like you and me. Having psychological, reputational, and financial stakes in one party of a dispute can induce biases. What I mean is, even good and smart people can fuck up, even with the best intentions. AFAIC, his story gets weighed on the same scale as everyone else's.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2824006 href="vote?for=2824006&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2824006></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=YuriNiyazov">YuriNiyazov</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2824006">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I really don't mean to imply pg is being dumb or anything like that — my experience is that even intelligent people tend to trust what their friends tell them. His comments seem to indicate that he hasn't been involved with the situation (which makes sense) and he's just repeating what he's heard from the AirBnB guys.<p>I don't know, she could be lying. But she has little incentive to do so. It's possible that somebody might give up a free house and become a transient just so they could trash-talk AirBnB, but it would be deeply weird. But a business owner spinning the facts to the benefit of his business? That would be deeply <i>normal</i>. Some might even argue it's his job. And a smart guy not extensively checking up on his friends when they tell him something? Again, that's normal.<p>Anyway, I'm not trying to say that we have to assume AirBnB is lying. We don't have a lot of evidence, so it makes sense to be tentative. But it seems unfair to very non-tentatively accuse EJ of lying when the facts seem to be on her side at best and on nobody's side at worst. You asked why people were downvoting, and I thought it was a fair question, so those are my thoughts.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2823661 href="vote?for=2823661&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2823661></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=llambda">llambda</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2823661">link</a></span></div><br>

But it's also awful to lay the blame on Airbnb and say they've done effectively nothing to help her. That begins to look an awful lot like someone is trying to make them look bad...

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Technically this part of Paul's comment does not contradict the victim's statement; AirBnB has offered to fix it from the beginning (give or take a day), but perhaps just forgot to communicate after that. Any calls from her could have ended up accidentally ignored by customer support or some other gate keeper.<p>However, that leaves two big issues in my view:<p>1 - This should have been handled by the CEO from day one. He can delegate the work down later, but the victim should have his phone number in case his minions screw up. The fact that he still believes a blog post is sufficient and that he throws in PR gimmicks such as doubling customer support (in a company that's growing exponentially), is not helping. But that is not at all evidence for...<p>2 - There needs to be some clarity really soon about whether AirBnB has attempted to cover this up, with Paul being miss-informed (I'm not ready to doubt his integrity), or if it's the other way around. I understand it is hard for AirBnB to disclose evidence in their favor, because they would risk defamation issues, privacy issues, precedent issues and even risk screwing up the police investigation. It's also difficult for the victim and journalists to present any definite evidence.<p>Perhaps both parties can agree to let an independent journalist with a solid reputation look into the situation? It may be hard to find anyone who considers this important enough though; sadly this sort of stuff tends to fade out in a matter of days.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2823456 href="vote?for=2823456&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2823456></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=eavc">eavc</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2823456">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62;The story Arrington wrote yesterday about Airbnb not offering to help was bullshit. He asked a company spokesman what Airbnb was doing to help her. The spokesman, who'd been told by their lawyers that he couldn't go into detail about that because of the precedent said "I can't comment on that." So Arrington, in typical Arrington fashion said "Well, unless you tell me I'm going to write that you're not willing to do anything for her." And he did. Really not cool.<p>Sounds like legitimate grounds for pursuing a case of libel.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2825389 href="vote?for=2825389&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2825389></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=donpark">donpark</a> 190 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2825389">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Blame the victim? That's the plan?<p>The company needs to do this to come out ok:<p>1) Go overboard helping her reset her  life
2) mea culpa: apologize for the handling of it
3) announce steps that will reduce the risk of it happening again
4) stop calling her credibility into account, or blaming Arrington. it's an international story now.
5) Control the message. PG--you shouldn't be posting at all. Your intentions might be good, your points might (or not) be valid, but you're creating more controversy.<p>The story goes away when 1) people hear a true apology for the handling and 2) EJ has been properly taken care of, regardless of AirBnB's culpability.<p>“On June 29 I posted my story, and June 30 thus marks the last day I heard from the customer service team regarding my situation. In fact, my appointed ‘liaison’ from Airbnb stopped contacting me altogether just three days after I reported the crime, on June 25, for reasons that are unknown to me. I have heard nothing from her since.”<p>“And since June 30? On this same day, I received a personal call from one of the co-founders of Airbnb. We had a lengthy conversation, in which he indicated having knowledge of the (previously mentioned) person who had been apprehended by the police, but that he could not discuss the details or these previous cases with me, as the investigation was ongoing. He then addressed his concerns about my blog post, and the potentially negative impact it could have on his company’s growth and current round of funding. During this call and in messages thereafter, he requested that I shut down the blog altogether or limit its access, and a few weeks later, suggested that I update the blog with a ‘twist’ of good news so as to ‘complete[s] the story.’”<p>“I am not clear here if Chesky is trying to convey the message that Airbnb was involved in securing my safety, but the company was not. My safety was secured by my own efforts.”<p>“The positive contribution mentioned in this statement might very well refer to the criminal investigation and communication with police; I can’t know for sure. But the staff at Airbnb has not made a positive contribution to me personally or my situation in any way, particularly since June 30.”</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2823809 href="vote?for=2823809&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2823809></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rexreed">rexreed</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2823809">link</a></span></div><br>

Person raped they sue the hotel "you didn't provide security" etc.<p>As another example, I saw a sign in an office parking lot. It said "security camera not always monitored" or something like that. In this litigious society the mere appearance of a camera gives the obligation to monitor the camera or a level of safety that the office lot is not willing to undertake.<p>Insurers don't have a model for an airbnb type operation. They will have a hard time wrapping their heads around insuring something that appears to be more of the business model that people would like airbnb to be.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I haven't been following this closely, but this morning I spent a couple of hours reading everything. FWIW...<p>1. There is nothing <i>inconsistent</i> in either of EJ's posts. They are sometimes complicated (e.g. who contacted who when) and I can imagine HN readers imagining inconsistencies as they scan the posts, but there are none.<p>2. Either EJ is telling lies, or Brian Chesky's post on TC misrepresents/distorts the truth in several places. Indeed, setting the record straight seems to have at least in part motivated EJ's second post.<p>3. It is just weird for the "niceness" of the founders to be relevant to this situation, except as part of a cynical effort to turn this into an "nasty EJ versus the nice founders" narrative.<p>4. Attacking Arrington (who, like EJ, <i>appears</i> to be offering more solid information than PG or Airbnb) comes off as another attempt to turn the Airbnb founders into the victims of this story.<p>Unless EJ is a liar, focusing any attention at all on the "plight" of the founders (e.g PG's message here) demonstrates a detachment from reality. They are warm and cozy in their homes, while she is homeless and shattered.<p>They got some bad coverage on TC, their exit payday might be compromised and rich people will lose money because of it. But unless she is a bald faced liar, her home was violated, she lost all the precious items (photos!) she spent a lifetime accumulating and she will spend a long time recovering from this episode.<p>Seems like as good a time as any to focus on the end user.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You guys really need to quit pointing fingers and focus on doing something positive.  You're getting the "bullshit" you complain of all over you.  As you should well know, one of the first rules of business is never to take it personally.  Here's a re-post of a suggestion I just made to Brian Chesky:<p>"Although there have been negative PR effects for Airbnb due to this incident, it appears that they have benefited as well, by wisely using the lesson learned to improve their business by adding essential insurance and pre-deal inter-member communications services, among other things. The future value of that benefit to a start-up company most likely far exceeds the damages suffered by this host, assuming the PR issue can be positively resolved. There was no similar benefit for the host, unless you count the lesson learned that they should avoid the sort of activity your business is built around.<p>"So here's a suggestion: acknowledge publicly that this incident exposed ways in which the service could be improved and offer to make this one host whole as compensation for that value. Solves everybody's problems in one fell swoop without accepting blame for something that isn't Airbnb's fault (and more importantly without resorting to blaming the victim - not the host's fault either). I'll bet it would cost far less than the usual media blitz companies commonly use to repair their images after incidents such is this. Consider it a good investment in the company's future."<p>It appears that Airbnb has made moves in this direction.  You say, and EJ confirms, that some financial compensation has been offered, but apparently EJ remains unconvinced that meaningful compensation will be forthcoming.  Given the mixed responses EJ has reported from Airbnb staff and mixed messages we see from Airbnb in the media (claims of compensation offers and links to TOS policies denying compensation), I can't say I blame her.  This needs to be remedied immediately, and all it would take is a press release and personal communication between Brian Chesky and EJ.  Her remarks which were far less flattering toward Airbnb in her second post could have been avoided had she been contacted by someone in authority at Airbnb expressing concern for her problem rather than concern for theirs.  You should have realized that her problem IS your problem.<p>The difference between "oh, they're the company that made immediate efforts to improve security and insurance options after being completely blindsided along with the host when somebody ransacked an apartment and went the extra mile to compensate the victim even though they weren't legally obligated to" and "oh, they're the company that was so concerned about the effects on their funding efforts that they tried to suppress the story and blame everyone else when one of their customers ransacked the apartment of another customer" when someone thinks of "Airbnb" depends wholly upon how the crisis is responded to.  So far, Airbnb has done at least as much to reinforce the latter image as the former.  You need message discipline and a positive message, and you need it now.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2829025 href="vote?for=2829025&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2829025></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jpstanley">jpstanley</a> 189 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2829025">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Responding publicly in this fashion was a pretty bad/unwise move on Paul's part.

It's a desperate move and I think anyone can see that.<p>Arrington is nobody's problem here. The problems are: (1) a customer of Airbnb was victimized, (2) Airbnb did not respond in a satisfactory manner (whether that means not swiftly enough or with results that left said customer feeling unhappy/unsafe), and (3) Airbnb allegedly attempted to quell the story in a distasteful way, implying that their company's well-being was more important than the customer's.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2823469 href="vote?for=2823469&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2823469></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ry0ohki">ry0ohki</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2823469">link</a></span></div><br>

You know, the whole "rob my place and I'll collect the insurance" schemes.<p>If Airbnb pays for this incident, they effectively become an insurance company. Maybe what they should do is offer some type of actual insurance package on checkout. This way, they are providing a much needed service and indemnify themselves. Making their customers aware of this possibility rather than pretend it doesn't exist would also help create a safer environment.</i><p>Paying to make this right _should_ come out of a big, huge, hairy insurance policy.  We haven't even begun to talk about the potential legal liability that AirBnb is under here.  If they don't have an insurance policy that covers this stuf...  You really shouldn't be in the hospitality business.<p>Dude, I work in an ER.  When someone slips on a wet floor in a grocery store, they do _whatever_ _it_ _takes_ to be sure the person is cared for, taken to the ER and checked out.  I've seen store managers drive people to the ER after getting hurt in their store.<p>Why?  Because you take care of people.  It's just good business.<p>Happy customers don't sue you.  Angry customers sue you, even if you didn't do anything wrong, and you have no legal liability whatsoever.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2821984 href="vote?for=2821984&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2821984></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=poink">poink</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2821984">link</a></span></div><br>

And worse will happen.  Shit happens, especially at scale.<p>&#62; <i>I think this problem kills the business model.</i><p>Nah.  Let's do a little back-of-the-napkining:<p>• Let's assume that this is the first incidence of such.<p>• Let's assume that Brian's quoted 2 million nights of rentals is accurate.<p>• AirBnB's fees are 6-12%.  To make things easy, let's assume an average rental of $50/night and 10% fees.<p>• There.  AirBnB has now made about $10 million in revenue.<p>• Total cost of fixing this is maybe tops of $100k.<p>So this eats into their margins by 1% assuming the numbers are roughly correct and assuming that insuring against such would cost about the same thing as paying out of pocket (but would also cover the more catastrophic cases).  Maybe it's a bit more and it's a couple percent, but it doesn't destroy the model by any means.<p>Also, if they offered insurance, they could do it as a default-on-with-scary-red-confirmation-text-if-you-uncheck upsell at a premium (say, cost + 20%) and make <i>more</i> money.<p>&#62; <i>But they have to change their company to address this problem</i><p>Going over the top on this one is the cost of waiting too long.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Insurance (and by extension dealing with insurance fraud) for this sort of thing is a solved problem.  They don't need to do it in house.

There's nothing particularly novel about insuring homes, their contents or vacation rentals.  An institutional insurer can crunch some numbers (with estimates on the average values of contents, caps on liability, frequency of incidents, cost of claims inspection, rate of fraud) and figure out what the risk profile on that is and then mark that up and sell it to Airbnb.<p>What's actually unclear to me, however, after crunching out a revenue estimate for Airbnb (which I'd assumed was higher) is if they're a big enough fish yet for an insurer to bother with them.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2821582 href="vote?for=2821582&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2821582></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=a3camero">a3camero</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2821582">link</a></span></div><br>

-Damage/theft caused by people with unverified identities (all they have is CC, stolen?)

I thought I made myself clear: they either need to change their company completely to deal with this problem, or they will cease to exist. I'm not certain that they <i>can</i> completely deal with this problem - the risks are much more open-ended than with ebay and PayPal. So I think it's possible the business model cannot survive - which I thought I made clear when I said it was not sustainable.<p>I'm arguing that their company may cease to exist because of this problem.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The way things are right now, maybe this blows over and the AirBnB business model continues just the way it was, with its associated massive valuation. If they help everyone in the way you are suggesting, the model is _definitely_ finished, because you cannot create the expectation that AirBnB will pick up the pieces every time something goes wrong. And the more people use the service, the mores cases like this there will be. Also, AirBnB are almost certainly getting legal advice that says not to have any unnecessary communication with EJ in preparation for a law suit that looks to me like it's inevitable.<p>So your sentiments are admirable, but not practical. My heart goes out to that girl too, I have to say. She's clearly a sensitive soul, and this has really messed her up. I hope she can get over it and move on.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2821534 href="vote?for=2821534&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2821534></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=forgotAgain">forgotAgain</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2821534">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Agreed AirBnB can't create the expectation of covering the cost of apartments being "trashed" for fear of abuse of the policy. You can be sure that their lawyers are vetting all messages too, for fear of creating a chain of liability, should they start covering the costs.<p>That said, what about offering a generous bounty? Say $1m in this case for the successful apprehension and prosecution of the guilty party (or parties). This figure would have to be ratcheted down after the initial PR success for fear of people committing such crimes in future with the intent of enriching their friend/relative who turns them in.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2823127 href="vote?for=2823127&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2823127></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=TheCondor">TheCondor</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2823127">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Hasn't the window already closed?    Short of doing everything you listed at considerable expense,  how does this get made right?   is that even enough?  The heirlooms are gone at this point,  you had a chance a few weeks ago but that stuff is long gone now.<p>There should have been a plan for this before it happened.   part of that would be "hey, we'll do all these things, x, y, and z,  in exchange please take your blog down"   or at least "please blog that you've been made whole by the company, without mentioning specifics" or if you're a real pro,  you present the victim with a contract before it even occurs to them to blog about it and you put that in it.  It's too late now.  Not just too late, but they've added to the "wrong" done to this woman.   Plus if you "fix it"  the pressure will be to reveal what was done, complete with rumors and misinformation bouncing around,  rumors you can't control or fix.<p>I think it's business 101 in some line of work.   Look at the LA Dodgers,  a fan was nearly beaten to death at a game earlier this year and the team had reduced the security, fired the chief of security and done some otherwise stupid things prior to this (read: the dodgers may be responsible.)   They can't stop the news,  it made the news, but they swooped in,  made some undisclosed financial arrangements and the news is about catching the criminals now.  FWIW, this fan will never make a full recovery.   The Dodgers have other problems and they aren't glossing over the beating but it's clearly not the focus it could be.<p>I've seen a remarkable number of tech companies do the same thing regarding security,  to the point of even knowing they have problems and choosing to ignore them and hope for forgiveness rather than spend the time and money to fix them.  If you're going to take that risk at least be prepared for when you lose.   You have to come correct and offer up enough that it doesn't make sense for people to be angry,  it has to be a legitimate apology with some contrition.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2821435 href="vote?for=2821435&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2821435></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=brianchesky">brianchesky</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2821435">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>A tip for you: I work in support, and weasel words are the substance of our being. You tell the customer "Do A, B, and C, and that should get you up and running". They don't really hear the 'should', but it needs to be there because computers are fickle and <i>anything</i> can go wrong. In short, I guess I'm saying I'm a bit more practised at recognising weasel words for what they are - and in this situation, it's not really an "anything bad is possible from here"; the worst <i>has</i> happened. This is the point in support where you start giving the client the concrete steps that will be taken to solve their issue.<p>"<i>again telling her</i>" is the weasel words I'm referring to here. You've already told her this, and she claims that after saying this, all help evaporated - <i>it's the cornerstone of her complaint, and you're announcing Round 2 of the same thing</i>. This is a PR disaster for your company: it is not the time to engage in weasel words. <i>Whether or not</i> you plan on following through, you should sound like you absolutely will. Of course, you should follow through - if something like this happened in my company, the CEO would be absolutely roasting us for not following through and taking measures into his own hands, both because he's an honourable bloke, and because it's a giant PR issue.<p>jcunningham above points out other weaselly things. Again, whether or not you're giving her concrete messages about what kind of help you're offering her, you should also be announcing these publicly. "We are reimbursing costs of -foo-", "We are organising temporary accommodation of her own", "We are doing this and this to help the police", "We've assigned John Doe to manage her case and will be in contact this often". Be concrete, not hand-wavy.<p>The guy you're replying to gave five ideas for supporting her, and the response is a wishy-washy "we'll be there for her" - which is the kind of empty promise you hear drunk 20-year-olds tell each other before they sleep with each other's best friends. I don't necessarily think all the things the GP said are right, but using weasel words in this situation is a path to PR failure in my opinion.<p>EDIT: the reason why I wrote all the above is that I read your comment and felt angry because it sounded like another fobbing off, more promises that are not going to be upheld (as the first round was allegedly not). I do not think I'm going to be unusual in this.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2821630 href="vote?for=2821630&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2821630></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rabc">rabc</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2821630">link</a></span></div><br>

And the host isn't bearing all of the risk- a guest could rent out a room and have the host murder them in their sleep. It's fundamentally a risky proposition, though I'm agree that the host bears more risk than the guest.<p><i>(search Google News for 'airbnb' and see how far the story has got so far)</i><p>Eh, search Google News for 'craigslist killer'- Craigslist is still doing alright for itself.

<span class="comment"><font color=#5a5a5a>Like others I have been following this and others passively as it's progressing. I'm not convinced the issue is as extreme as others are predicting.<p>I do agree that AirBnB should do more in this case though - from afar it looks like their reaction is based out of fear (Oh <i>f%$k</i> it happened, now what?! Let's get rid of it fast!) rather than compassion, it's impossible to say for sure, that's just what it looks like to me as an outsider. Compassion for the customer/victim/human being seems like a <i>no brainer</i>.  I, too, agree with the sentiment that people are generally good and want to do the right thing. I'm hoping that the reason there has not been the level of support that seems to be expected is the result of fear. Fear for what others will expect <i>when</i> it happens again.<p>If they choose to not change their approach as a result or do anything at all here will it kill the company?  At this point I doubt it. It's not good but I don't think it's a company killer, they're more at risk from being killed by regulation than bad PR I think.<p>As an opportunistic entrepreneur like others here my instinct is to look at it as an opportunity for good PR but that is quickly overcome by simple empathy, someone has been hurt by the product. Even if you consider it to be indirect someone still got hurt while interacting with the system. I personally choose to do business with companies and individuals who are <i>people</i> first and <i>professionals</i> second. That means businesses acting to <i>Cover My Ass</i> first are weak and those who act to <i>do the right thing</i> are atrong. I conduct my own business with the same thinking.<p>At this point it doesn't look like Chesky and company are the latter but rather acting with thinking from the former. The question I'm curious about is simply: <i>why?</i> I don't understand what circumstance would cause me in Chesky's shoes to not call her and at the very least be a compassionate human being until it was resolved to a reasonable extent. Something is amiss. edw519, some of your suggestions might be a bit extreme but surely something can be done to help her as it seems not enough has been done. <i>Why not?</i></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2824029 href="vote?for=2824029&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2824029></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nhangen">nhangen</a> 191 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2824029">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's important to teach children to obey authority figures. It's also important to teach them critical thinking skills and learn how to detect when a thing is arbitrary. However, instead of teaching the child to disrupt the authority in place, I think it is preferable to teach the children to obey unless there is a moral imperative against doing so.<p>For instance, while your son's teacher may assign him some silly work, while there is no reason to do this work other than the teacher said so, he should learn to work within the framework and do the work anyway because he is subject to the teacher in his current circumstances. If the teacher, however, assigns him to physically harm another student or participate in another morally objectionable act, he should refuse to comply. Things go much smoother this way than they do if people are constantly nagging and arguing over things that really have no incident; much energy could be saved by both your son and his teacher by compliance with non-useful but non-harmful requests rather than disrupting the flow of instruction and encouraging further disorder and disrespect to authority.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2814859 href="vote?for=2814859&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2814859></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pbhjpbhj">pbhjpbhj</a> 192 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2814859">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62;<i>I think it is preferable to teach the children to obey unless there is a moral imperative against doing so</i><p>// I'm not teaching my kids to be anarchists ;0) But equally well I'm not happy for them to be drones or to accept the word of others without reflection on the truth/moral good/right action.<p>&#62;<i>while there is no reason to do this work other than the teacher said so</i><p>// That's a pretty good reason and one that, within the school framework is hard to argue against. The only sorts of arguments that will work against such reasoning are those arguing for a greater moral good or similar.<p>&#62;<i>Things go much smoother this way than they do if people are constantly nagging and arguing over things that really have no incident;</i><p>Who decides what has no incident. Things that matter to one don't to another.<p>Let me give an example of the sorts of issues that he currently has to address, they're pretty low level: The school has a policy where the teachers lead a class out at a time from the building to be met by parents/carers. The teacher tells them to put their coats on, but it's often too hot to do so and my lad is there in summer in a jumper and coat (causing a minor harm to himself) because he's being obedient. Weather here is very changeable. His jumper and coat should rightly be in his bag. I say he should tell the teacher "it's too hot to wear my coat, can I put it in my bag please". The teacher is possibly menopausal and may be having difficulty assessing the temperature - should he just put his coat on, or should he make a [albeit small] stand with the possible outcome being the greater comfort of all the class [ie they wear appropriate levels of clothing]?<p>&#62;<i>disrespect to authority</i><p>I don't consider it disrespectful to question someone’s reason or motive in giving an instruction. Indeed if you can't explain why one should carry out your instructions then you need to question them.<p>I could be wrong but I think the child questioning the reason to put on a coat in hot weather today, if they learn to reason an argument, is better equipped to question those who have authority in more vital questions tomorrow.<p>If something has no incident then why demand it's fulfilment?</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2814517 href="vote?for=2814517&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2814517></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=aedocw">aedocw</a> 193 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2814517">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's INCREDIBLY important to teach children to obey authority figures WITHIN REASON.  If a teacher, cop or fireman is asking your kid to do something that doesn't seem quite right, their first instinct should be to ignore them, and get help from someone they know.  The only people a kid should blindly obey is their own parents.<p>As far as I know, very few people teach their kids that it's OK to question authority (within reason - and yes, respect authority always.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>That doesn't seem to be the conclusion of said experiment. 
"In Milgram's first set of experiments, 65 percent (26 of 40)[1] of experiment participants administered the experiment's final massive 450-volt shock, though many were very uncomfortable doing so; at some point, every participant paused and questioned the experiment, some said they would refund the money they were paid for participating in the experiment."
IMHO Milgram's experiment has more to do with obedience than ethics.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2814347 href="vote?for=2814347&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2814347></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=alanh">alanh</a> 193 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2814347">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm not so sure about this.  People might <i>know</i> what is good (for the most part), but in weakness it is violated, and in strength it is often ignored to pursue self-interest.<p>Let's just say that, I've been betrayed, and I'm very aware of the circumstances needed to be betrayed by people I care about -- some of them are impossibly extreme (and some aren't so much), but they do exist, and you do have to navigate that.  Whether the person would be apologetic or not after the fact really doesn't enter into it.<p>If one lives, I think you automatically develop protections against other people.  I think that you've set up a protection zone around yourself just like everyone else.  But it's a good one -- instead of withdrawing, you simply force the surface interaction to be a positive one (as much as you can).  Sometimes this translates, sometimes it can backfire.  For what it's worth, I think this is the right way to go.  You can be wary, but still positive about your interactions.<p>But there's a necessary bit of detachment -- I can wave to people on the street, but I'm not going to let just anyone into my apartment.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2812840 href="vote?for=2812840&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2812840></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nhangen">nhangen</a> 193 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2812840">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>That doesn't follow at all.<p>First, I'd like to be clear that I'm not advocating for or against AirBnB (and my sole experience as a buyer of accommodation via AirBnB was positive).<p>It should be transparent that different actions have different levels of risk and reward.  Often by accepting higher risk (e.g. accepting the risk of letting strangers into your apartment) you can get higher reward (e.g. some money, a sense of community and connection, etc).  But risk is risk, and so you can also get anti-rewards, sometimes huge ones (home ransacked and burglarized and vandalized, identity stolen, sense of life violated, etc).<p>If you want to draw conclusions from events like this, they should be about modulating your risk tolerance, not about setting your risk tolerance to zero (which is incoherent anyway).  You might decide that although things like this happen, it's a risk you're willing to take.  Or maybe not.  You might decide that if you're going to rent your apartment out to sight-unseen strangers, you're going to put all your identity documents in a safety deposit box first, to slightly limit the maximum damage.  Or you might decide that that would offset the benefit too much, and thereby just go back to the no-renting-to-strangers option.  Or you might decided to take martial arts lessons, and not let strangers in.  Or you might decided to install security cameras, with real-time transmission to offsite backup, so that if something bad happens you'll always be able to strike back and regain a sense of control.  Whatever.  All of those options are coherent alternatives, and all are a far cry from 'never leave your own home, never let anyone in'.<p>It's certainly true that simply walking down the street requires trust, and it's certainly true that transforming strangers into friends is a process that requires risking trust, but both of those _can_ be done with very small trusts.  Or they can be done with large trust, which has greater risk, greater possible reward, and greater possible injury.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2813234 href="vote?for=2813234&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%68%5a%65%50%65%56%32%73%76%79"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2813234></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sbov">sbov</a> 193 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2813234">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The vast majority of People are good yes. The main problem is that most people stop caring too quickly. On a multidimensional empathetic scale they stop caring with a nigh exponential drop off the further away from the this and now the other person is. Once someone's genetic and then phenotypic expression is far away from theirs, once the spacial, chronological and cultural locations etc. are diverged; people stop caring enough. Sometimes the person that they do not care about is their future self.<p>The keyword is enough. Certainly if everyone was too empathetic that would neither be good. But I do think the world would be a better place if more people did not set the line of when to stop caring and empathizing so close to Now and Me.
