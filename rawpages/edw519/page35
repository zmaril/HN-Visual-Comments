<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Here's what you need to do:<p>1. Find someone who needs help.<p>2. Help them.<p>That's it.  It's not about you and your skills and your intelligence and your blessings and your depression and your inner psychology etc. etc. etc.  It's about others.<p>They may need help in an area you're already familiar with, but maybe not.  Either way, you'll learn something new, they'll get where they need to be, and your situation will profoundly morph into something else.<p>The sooner you start helping someone else, the sooner you will wonder how you could have ever posted this.  A hundred ideas will come your way when you least expect them, along with the energy to do something about them.  You will find that there's lots to be done and you're the perfect person to do them.  You'll have a different problem then.  You'll need help getting all of it done.  So you'll be making a very different post to hn.

Go somewhere you don't speak the language, and where they won't be good at English.  Don't do the tourist locations.  Find out how other people live their daily lives and reflect upon it.<p>Perhaps you will want to help people less fortunate than yourself.  Perhaps you'll want to help people like yourself because you discover that you are actually less fortunate in some other sense.<p>At the very worse, don't waste your life on video games and internet, unless you're going to create a video game that might need to be online.<p>I had an even longer-winded reply, but it basically boils down to the 2 steps from edw519.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_1992969 href="vote?for=1992969&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%49%4b%44%31%42%75%38%67%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_1992969></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=groaner">groaner</a> 421 days ago  | <a href="item?id=1992969">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>_Do More Faster_ by Techstars founders Brad Feld and David Cohen<p>(Apologies to OP's request for brevity; there's just a lot of good stuff that I'd like to share.)<p>A must read for anyone here who is serious about their startup.<p>I read it on the flight to Startup School to "get in the mood". I couldn't put it down.<p>It's easy to read for 2 reasons: every chapter is a short essay by a different person (including many Techstars alumni) and it's very well written, almost like pg essays but by lots of different people. It covers lots of ground, much of which has been covered here at hn many times, but then again, some of this stuff can't be covered too often. Also, sometimes someone says the same thing a little differently, and that's the one that actually reaches you.<p>My 300 page copy has 50 or 60 dog-earred pages and hundreds of red marks; it's that full of gems. (For that reason, I highly suggest buying a hard copy and keeping it on your bookshelf for future reference.)<p>I think that yc should come out with a similar book. I'd love to read essays from yc alumni, their advisors, and of course the yc principals themselves about what they thought was important. I realize much of this is on-line already, but there's nothing like a great hard copy too.<p>A few of my favorite quotes from _Do More Faster_:<p>"I realized that I had two options. I could quit buying comics or I could quit my job and build the iTunes of comics." - Kevin Mann<p>"Getting feedback and new ideas is the lifeblood of any startup. There is no point in living in fear of someone stealing your idea." - Nate Abbott and Natty Zola<p>"That means every moment you're working on something without it being in the public arena, it's actually dying, deprived of the oxygen of the real world." - Matt Mullenweb<p>"Focus on the smallest possible problem you could solve that would potentially be useful" - David Cohen<p>"You know you're on to something when the community starts donating money to make sure it stays alive." - Darren Crystal<p>"In companies that rely on having a large user base as ours does, it is very unlikely that you will offend enough people quickly enough to dampen your future growth." - Sean Corbett<p>"We learned that very few people care how you accomplish something. Instead, these people care more about whether you create value for your end user." - Colin Angle<p>"We knew that the high-level concept of our first site still really inspired us." - Alex White<p>"They stepped back from what they had created and thought about what they could do better than anyone else in the world." - editors<p>"During the first few days of every TechStars cycle, we tell the 10 bright-eyed new teams that one of them will not be together at the end of the program. Unfortunately, we have not been wrong yet." - editors<p>"If you can't quit no matter how hard you try, then you have a chance to succeed." - Laura Fitton<p>"When you ask CEOs of major companies what they're most worried about, one common answer is 'a couple of guys in a garage somewhere.'" - David Cohen<p>"Companies that work just always seem to move at lightning pace." - David Cohen<p>"It turns out that giving up your one obvious competitive advantage often proves to be deadly. If a startup can't do more faster, it usually just gets dead faster." - David Cohen<p>"There is an enormous difference between exciting technology and an exciting business." - Howard Diamond<p>"Changes come daily, weekly, and monthly - not once a quarter or once a year." - Ari Newman<p>"While it was only a detour of a week, that's a lot in TechStars time." - Bill Warner<p>"Only hope instead is to listen to their head and their heart and follow a path that they believe in, keeping some of the feedback and discarding other thoughts and ideas." - Bill Warner<p>"...when presented with exponential growth, remember that people tend to drastically overestimate what will happen in the short term, but will profoundly underestimate what happens over longer time spans." - Ryan McIntyre<p>"...consider life as a founder of a startup to be one big intelligence test." - Ryan McIntyre<p>"Remember that human nature has a tendency to admire complexity, but to reward simplicity." - Ben Huh<p>"If you are innovating, you actually don't know what your product needs to be. Furthermore, your customers don't either. No one does." - Ajay Kulkarni and Andy Cheung<p>"Nearly every startup must find ways to differentiate itself from competitors." - Raj Aggarwai<p>"What is the thing that matters most to making progress right now?" - Dick Costolo<p>"...you cannot create the need." - Michael Zeissner<p>"Opportunity cost can kill a startup." - Michael Zeissner<p>"It's easy to feel trapped by these handcuffs but if you change your perspective just a little, you might find that you hands are bound by nothing more than air, and the future is yours to create." - Eric Marcoullier<p>"There is one thing that the hundred of founders I meet each year have in common, and that is that their plan is wrong. Sometimes it's the big things, sometimes it's the little things, but the plan is always wrong." - Rob Hayes<p>"...we have to strike while the iron is hot! My experience is that this is rarely true." - David Brown<p>"Take the time to get it right and you'll find that those competitors might not be as close as you think." - David Brown<p>"Seeking the perfect combo: 'a smart-ass team with a kick-ass product in a big-ass market.'" - Jeff Clavier<p>"The moral of the story is easy: When you follow your heart, good things usually happen. We have a very short stay on this spinning orb and I believe life is way too short to be stuck in a career that doesn't fulfill you." - Mark Solon</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_1974637 href="vote?for=1974637&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%49%4b%44%31%42%75%38%67%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_1974637></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=aik">aik</a> 425 days ago  | <a href="item?id=1974637">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Yelling at the TV is a long-established American tradition. :)<p>Sebastian's got a great article here -- he's really been on a roll lately. The only thing I'd add is that sometimes you can't do anything. When I read that book on stoicism last month, one of the key points was that you need to sort out the things you can change, the things you can't, and the things you have some bit of leverage with. Ignore the things you can't change, act on the ones you can.<p>The ones in the middle -- the things you can change but only a little bit -- you internalize, separating the parts that you own and the parts you don't.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; "The announcers don't understand the game!"<p>Actually, this one we could do something about, no? I agree that professional sports announcing is terrible for people who are seriously into the game. So, could we build either an official or amateur broadcasting/dub-over of the commentary?<p>Would NFL Network carry an alternate commentary version of the game, with more football commentary and less nonsense about who is dating what celebrity? Could you do it unofficially? I bet it'd be really, really popular.<p>That's why I like "So, what are we going to do about it?" - Even if you don't do it, you might get some interesting ideas. If there was a serious analysis/no nonsense/no frills football commentary, I might tune in to that. Things like analyzing the plays, the line play, the coverages, how different players size/speed/length of arms make a difference, etc.<p>Anyway, Patriots fan but I always liked the Steelers. Classy organization, heavy focus on defense and an efficient game. Hope the two see each other in the AFC championship game.<p>Edit: Also, sometimes you decide it just isn't worth bothering because you've got more important stuff to do. It's still a fun thought exercise in that case, and occasionally you stumble on something cool.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_1973419 href="vote?for=1973419&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%49%4b%44%31%42%75%38%67%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_1973419></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=steveklabnik">steveklabnik</a> 425 days ago  | <a href="item?id=1973419">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>From what was posted, it would seem the audience was sampled too soon.  Wouldn't this fall under the 90 second attention span problem?<p>Edit: expansion -<p>This reminds me of an experience related to me by a concert goer.  Dan Hicks was scheduled to follow a classical performance artist (pianist?) - Very poor combination, musically.  He played a couple of songs and the audience, presumably there to hear more classical, got quieter and quieter.<p>Before the next song, someone dropped coins and they slowly, audibly rolled down the sloped floor to the front of the stage.  Mr. Hicks was reported to have said something along the lines of "I feel about the same," put away his instrument and left the stage.<p>If the audience is not a part of a performance, not giving any feedback, the artist has negative feedback, and I assume this is where the phrase "I died up there" came from (see George Carlin's little talk on violent terms for performance art for audiences).<p>Mr. Martin's complaint is that he was not given the time to react to the loss of audience, once the repartee was interrupted with the first audience-requested conversation topic.  The continued interruptions prevented any reboot from happening.<p>I use similar feedback techniques when teaching high-tech knowledge to groups.  Very dry stuff, and if not handled carefully, a great chance for a nap.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_1972390 href="vote?for=1972390&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%49%4b%44%31%42%75%38%67%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_1972390></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=lwhi">lwhi</a> 426 days ago  | <a href="item?id=1972390">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>on a white board, no syntax errors, compilable</i><p>Huh?  You're worrying about whether or not what you write on a white board will compile?  How do you know?  Press a magic button to OCR what you've written, download it into some computer somewhere, and compile it?  Sounds like you're interviewing at firms with technology I didn't know existed.<p>Your interviewers have you code on a white board so that they can evaluate <i>you</i>, not your code.  They want to see how you handle a problem, how you approach your work, how you think on your feet, how you deal with interaction, and how your intelligence and experience applies to their business.  Anyone who worries about whether white board code actually compiles is missing the point.  If they're more interested in perfect syntax than embracing you and your potential contribution, then you don't want to work for them anyway.<p>I think you're making this too hard on yourself.  Memorize nothing.  Just be yourself.  Programming is like riding a bike; once it's part of your DNA, you don't have to worry about it.  Just relax, trust your inner programmer, and let this become a self-solving problem; some jerks may reject you, but the right fit will come when someone sees who you really are.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_1966131 href="vote?for=1966131&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%49%4b%44%31%42%75%38%67%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_1966131></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bmj">bmj</a> 428 days ago  | <a href="item?id=1966131">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I agree, though I think, perhaps, the author has a point about something.  It's one thing to be asked to write code on the whiteboard for a practical problem.  During the interview process for my current employer, I was asked to sketch out a database design for a given application, including actually writing out some of the SQL to generate the tables, constraints, etc.  I was then asked to write queries to pull reports against my schema.  I was also asked to show some code to pull said queries from the database, in the language of my choice.<p>Those sorts of questions seems appropriate for the position in question.  Asking me to implement a linked list or binary tree?  Not so applicable.  Might I use these sorts of things?  Yeah, but the senior engineers assume I know how to use Google.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_1966391 href="vote?for=1966391&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%49%4b%44%31%42%75%38%67%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_1966391></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=aplusbi">aplusbi</a> 428 days ago  | <a href="item?id=1966391">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's often hard to ask relevant questions that will fit into the time allotted for an interview.  Your DB schema example is a good one - it shows that the candidate can design (and to a lesser extent, implement) an application.  Your example (I'm assuming) is missing strong algorithmic problem solving however.  It would be good to have an additional question to test this kind of knowledge.<p>It's also important to realize that most technical interviews are really about weeding out bad candidates than finding good ones.<p>It may also be necessary to have questions general enough that any given candidate stands a chance at solving it.  If a candidate doesn't have SQL experience your example would be bad (assuming the company didn't require SQL experience).<p>This is why you see questions like "implement a binary tree."  Any competent programmer should be able to implement a binary tree.  If they have never seen a binary tree before, they are simple enough to describe in 5 minutes.<p>I once asked a candidate to implement a trie.  He had never heard of a trie before so I drew one on the whiteboard and briefly explained it.  He asked me a few questions and then proceeded to implement one.  We then discussed the pros and cons of different methods to store the nodes (vector, list, map).  It showed me that, given a spec, he could code a data structure and the following discussion showed me he understood memory and time constraints.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_1966420 href="vote?for=1966420&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%49%4b%44%31%42%75%38%67%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_1966420></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bmj">bmj</a> 428 days ago  | <a href="item?id=1966420">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Good points, but, how many interviewers would severely penalize someone for not even knowing what a binary tree was?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>I would assume that, given a description, they probably wouldn't be able to code one (or code much of anything).</i><p>That's a pretty glaring assumption, especially since it's subject to empirical verification.  It also contains an assumption of its own -- that all programming needs a heavyweight familiarity with algorithms.  There's a lot of programming contexts where the productive programmer just uses a hash so the mental bandwidth can be devoted to something else.<p>(FWIW, I do sometimes wish those programmers knew a little more about algorithms.)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_1966785 href="vote?for=1966785&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%49%4b%44%31%42%75%38%67%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_1966785></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=aplusbi">aplusbi</a> 428 days ago  | <a href="item?id=1966785">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I agree that it is a glaring assumption, and perhaps is "culturally" biased.
