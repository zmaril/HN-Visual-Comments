<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Yes, it is harder than supporting Firefox.<p>Lean Designs makes <i>heavy</i> use of the canvas element and it would be impossible to implement on a browser like IE8 that doesn't support it.

All names (variables, functions, routines, etc.) should accurately describe what they represent as closely as possible.  i.e. an intelligent user should be able to read your code and get a fairly good idea what it does.<p>6. No variable name should be fully self-contained within another variable name.<p>7. Indent however many spaces you want and use white space however you want.  Who gives a shit.<p>8. Shop standards only count if they are published.<p>9. Only enter your IDE if you have actually have something to code.  Otherwise go back to your pencil/paper/whiteboard (or whatever you use for analysis and design) and don't come back until you're ready.<p>10. Prototype <i>something</i> and let the user rip it to shreds.  Funny how much less bashful they become when they have something to critique.

I'll be out of jail in 30 days.<p>The original programmer will be fine once the stitches are removed.<p>Actually, all kidding aside, yesterday I enhanced a 1700 line program with these variables:<p><pre><code>  Cust
  CustCmmts
  CustComments
  DelCmmts
  CustNbr
  DelDate
  Cmmts
  CustID
  Comments
  CustDel
  Del
</code></pre>
The variables "Cust", "Cmmts", "Comments", and "Del" should have different names.  What are they?  I spent half a day just trying to figure out what everything was, one line at a time.  You can't globally locate, edit, cut, paste, or change without fucking up everything else.  (And please don't ask me to use a fancier IDE.

I don't want to talk about work at lunch.<p>2. I want to get out of the office and get some fresh air.<p>3. I often want to get away from the very people that Joel suggests spending time with on my break.<p>4. I'm a "food outlier".  I hate pizza, deli, and fast food.  I won't eat it away from work.  Why should I eat it there?<p>5. Sometimes I want a beer with my lunch.<p>6. Sometimes I just want to close my eyes for 5 minutes.<p>7. If my work mates are talking about something other than work, I'm probably not interested.  I'd rather chew razor blades than talk about traffic, weather, casino gambling, baseball, real estate taxes, gun control, politics, or Dancing with the Stars.  I'd rather shoot myself than hear <i>anything</i> about their children.<p>8. If I am going to talk about work, I will want to bitch about the boss.  Tough to do if he/she is there.<p>9. If I am going to talk about work, I want everyone else to talk freely and openly.  This never happens.  They will bitch about anyone else if they're not there, but when we're all together, they act like everything is just peachy.  Phoneys.<p>10. "Enforced association" is phoney.  I'd rather just make my own friends at work or out of work.  So what if it appears to be a clique?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I had a totally different reaction to Joel's post.  He seemed to emphasize shaping corporate culture <i>deliberately</i>  in positive ways, rather than letting things happen by accident. He emphasizes creating a positive social environment in the office: welcoming new people and promoting inclusivity.<p>It seems like you mostly object to one line in Joel's post:<p><i>when new people start work at the company, they’re not allowed to sit off by themselves in a corner</i><p>I agree with you that it sounds a bit Draconian.  But I don't think that was Joel's primary point.  It's more of an implementation detail.  He's contrasting his efforts with other environments, where people don't naturally get included.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Right, because everyone who loves their job also loves sitting down to have lunch with their coworkers who they see for not less than seven hours a day five days a week.<p>Personally I think this is an utterly ridiculous idea. Perhaps you love it. Perhaps many others do too. But perhaps also there are those of us who want to spend their lunchtimes not socialising but meditating; who want to be alone rather than with others; who want get outside and have a change of scenery. Gosh, perhaps they even want to meet <i>other people</i> for lunch! As shocking as it may seem to you, all of these things are entirely compatible with enjoying one's job.<p>At my last job (which I can only I assume I must have hated, although to be honest it didn't seem like it at the time) I almost always went out for lunch, on my own. Sometimes I made a sandwich that morning; often I bought something from the market. I bought a coffee; I took my time. I thought about the problems I was working on, and often, it was the most productive time of the whole day. I figured out the architecture of the applications I was building, and wrote code in my head. When I got back to the office, I sat down at the computer and typed it in. In fact, I'd probably go so far as to say that if I'd been sitting down and chatting while I had lunch, my overall productivity would have dropped precipitously.<p>This is by no means an argument against socialising with one's coworkers; it's not even an argument against having lunch with them. All I'm saying is that we're not all like you.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2494777 href="vote?for=2494777&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2494777></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=InfinityX0">InfinityX0</a> 283 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2494777">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Before I start I'll address the first point - yes, everything has good and bad sides, but that <i>includes</i> things/people you love. I doubt Beethoven always loved composing, or Einstein always loved doing science - it's a net thing, and when it involves something/somebody you love, the joy vastly exceeds the cost.<p>&#62; Applying the concept of love to something as mundane as a job is ridiculous<p>Please, speak for yourself. <i>You</i> might find it ridiculous, <i>you</i> might not think it important to do something you love, and you'd be joining the 99.999% of people out there who live their lives treating the vast majority of their waking hours as being somehow irrelevant to happiness. But consider this - you might be wrong.<p>"The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd; indeed, in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind, a wide-spread belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible." - Russell<p>&#62;Just a couple of generations ago, a job was a job was a job? Why, because a job meant survival. You either work your ass off, or you and your family starve. Did all these people love the hard labor, getting up at 4am to tend to a withering field? These generations were much more fatalistic about life and accepted bad things as an inevitable part of life."<p>Yes - some generations ago, work meant misery for the majority of people but - newsflash - we're <i>not</i> a couple of generations ago. We have experienced miraculous changes in the way the majority of people live, and it would be quite the insult to all those who have struggled to change things to say 'well it was misery generations ago, so why treat it any differently now?' - I can't think of a more retrograde or negative attitude. A few generations ago people died from simple infections - so why bother administering antibiotics? You could go on in that vein.<p>For some of us there is more to engaging in a certain activity than its ends, where the work itself transcends its purpose and becomes a pleasure in itself - a craftsman who really cares about his work sees the world very differently from a administrative functionary whose work is, by definition, mundane, repetitive and meaningless to them.<p>It's not <i>all</i> jobs, hell it's very <i>few</i> jobs out there, and certainly not for everybody - not everybody has it in them, or even the desire, to love their work but for those of us that do it is a very real possibility.<p>A lot of the problem I have with your attitude is that, for the minority who do see work as more than just a means-to-an-end, it is quite a struggle to fight against the prevailing attitude that you demonstrate and I really find it surprising that an HNer feels that way, and is especially frustrating for me as I am stuck in a job I emphatically am very unhappy in, fighting and struggling to get myself up to a level of ability where I can get a job in which I can practice my craft happily, and as a result I am considered fairly mad by a chunk of my friends + family.<p>pg puts it far more eloquently than I could [1]:-<p>"The test of whether people love what they do is whether they'd do it even if they weren't paid for it—even if they had to work at another job to make a living."<p>A few generations ago getting a job you love just wasn't possible for the vast majority. Now, and especially in software development, it is, and in fact as a result of the cheapness and ubiquity of computers + open source, etc. it is possible for somebody (at least in the west) to really pursue the craft regardless of circumstances. Please don't downplay that - it's nothing short of a damn miracle, really.<p>[1]:<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2497163 href="vote?for=2497163&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2497163></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=singular">singular</a> 282 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2497163">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You are not everybody else. Some people are very busy and use their lunch for all sorts of things: Time to read a book.

Time to go home and make food that you want to eat! The list goes on. It is my time, not anybody else's. If the group lunches are so wonderful, friendly, and relaxing, then people will show up to them, but anything approaching pressure to do so is patently absurd.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2494611 href="vote?for=2494611&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2494611></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kujawa">kujawa</a> 283 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2494611">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Does anyone not feel a sense of unease when applying all of these "social" filters to hiring decisions? The end result here is you end up hiring people exactly like yourself (and the rest of the group). Being able to do the job well is no longer enough; you have to be "interesting" enough to spend an hour with at lunch everyday. What this essentially comes down to is you need to also be a part of the same culture with the same personality type.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's fine to not really <i>love</i> talking to colleagues about their children, but if it's so unpleasant for you to "hear anything about their children" that you'd hyperbolize it by saying you'd "rather shoot [your]self", then that's a problem.

That means lots of hard work that rarely pays off (by having a healthy kitten that gets adopted, there is no money in it, obviously), depressing amount of death and suffering, participating in such great activities as autopsies and interventions.<p>It was a significant part of our lives, our passion and when it paid off, it brought immense satisfaction. It was a very natural subject of talk for us, but really -- do you want to hear about the state of an inflamed heart we found in a dissected kitten, what happens to bodily functions when some dude flails a cat while holding it by the tail, how a neglected cat lost her eye to disease or other fascinating subjects from this category? All those conversations while eating?<p>Then why should people who aren't passionate about children endure conversations about children defecating? Really. I can handle it, of course (while I don't love it), but I can repay with a story about a dog eating her own intestines, so I'm probably not a benchmark for most sensitive listener.<p>People not wanting to hear about babies are just like people not wanting to hear about eyes falling out of sockets, it's only ours (yeah, I can talk about babies too) presuppositions that make the subjects seem so different.<p>(btw, if you rob me of my daily walk, I will fall asleep in your office)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2494608 href="vote?for=2494608&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2494608></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mrcharles">mrcharles</a> 283 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2494608">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm a big fan of group meals and I've seen a fair amount of camaraderie built this way.  That said, this reminds me of a team based PM course I was in a few years ago. Our group was made up of about a dozen people from different disciplines and we were asked "How do you know someone is being friendly to you?"<p>Most people had pretty common answers ("A smile, a greeting, etc") but one engineer said something that really confused the class:  "Just don't bother me."  That answer instantly expanded my understanding of team interaction.  He wasn't saying it to be rude-he sincerely meant that letting him concentrate on his own business was a sign of endearment.<p>Most people enjoy (or, at least, don't mind) the lunches, group activities, etc. but some people don't.  The job of management is to cultivate a productive group environment.  Whether this includes regular group activities or not depends upon the individuals in the group.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2494667 href="vote?for=2494667&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2494667></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sspencer">sspencer</a> 283 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2494667">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"Interviewing the interviewer" is an important strategy to help understand what you're getting into and helping to make sure the whole process remains two-way.  But it's a fine line between making an assessment and appearing selfish.  Many of OP's questions are problematic...<p><i>“How many clients has the company added in the past year?”</i><p>I would prefer trying to assess growth rates outside the interview.  In many cases, you should be able to get an idea some other way.  This question shows lack of initiative.  And, in many cases, the interviewer may not even be permitted to answer it.<p><i>“What has the employee turnover rate been over the past 24 months?”</i><p>Too much focus on the negative.  You don't like when they ask, "Why did you only stay with Company X for 3 months?"  They'll feel the same way.<p><i>“What’s the company’s policy on work/life balance?”</i><p>You might as well say, "I intend to deliver 40 hours of my time for 40 hours of pay.  If you need extra help, ask someone else.  Big turnoff.<p><i>“What kind of tools are provided to help me do my job?”</i><p>Better: "What kinds of things do you need me to do to help the company achieve its goals.<p><i>“In the first 60 to 90 days, what’s my first priority?”</i><p>Actually, this is a great question.  It can paint a good picture of your life and shows that you're ready to get to work.<p><i>“Are employees required to sign a non-compete contract?”</i><p>By asking this, you are identifying yourself as a problem.  If someone asked me this question, the first thing I would think would be, "What is he up to and what is my risk?"<p>For technology companies, just assume that the answer to this question is "Yes" and sign it.<p>When interviewing someone else, I appreciate good questions.  They show interest and possibility.  But I get a bit concerned when too many questions are of the variety of "What's in it for me?"<p>I think it's always a better idea to present yourself with President Kennedy's attitude: "Ask not what the company can do for you, ask what you can do for the company."  Find a way to present yourself that way while still learning everything you need to know.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2489509 href="vote?for=2489509&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2489509></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Timothee">Timothee</a> 284 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2489509">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The point of the article is to counter the general imbalance in the company/interviewee relationship by making sure the interviewee interviews the company back.<p>Your rebuttal however feels very much from the company's perspective.<p>If the company squirms or is concerned because they're asked questions like this, I think it's actually worrying. Companies <i>will</i> ask why you stayed at a company for a short period of time. Asking about tools is a good way to evaluate how easy it would be to get things done: if a company won't spend an extra $2k on a new computer of your choice, it's not a good sign. Asking about work/life balance is the same thing: you won't get a definite answer but you should get a glimpse of if you'll be asked to travel across the country at the last minute on your daughter's birthday or not.<p>In the end, you won't get completely truthful answers but the way they are answered will give you hints. (and to be fair, interviewees also embellish their answers)<p>Asking "what's in it for me?" seems a fair question. Generally, the feeling is that the risk is on the company's part, but as an employee you might be wasting your time, your opportunities and later you'll have to explain why you worked for only three months at a company.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2489511 href="vote?for=2489511&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2489511></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=trevelyan">trevelyan</a> 284 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2489511">link</a></span></div><br>

I agree with the general tone of your post Edward, but strongly disagree with this. Anyone working in a field they have any possibility of working in again should never sign something that will complicate that. And the same with ownership of IP developed on personal time.<p>Once a company has made the decision to hire you they are invested in you. If you can't get them to bend on amending the contract don't sign it. Starting your own company is stressful enough without the possibility for an ex-employer to take legal action. Add that to the fact that people are much less likely to start a business in a field totally unrelated to what they currently do, and you have something that is entrepreneurial suicide.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2489898 href="vote?for=2489898&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2489898></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=a5seo">a5seo</a> 284 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2489898">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>By far, limiting the IP clause is most important thing to get while you're in the negotiation stage.  HR and legal will move mountains to get a key hire made, but once you're in, all the power is in their hands.<p>I recommend asking to exclude any ideas developed on personal time OR not formally documented or manifested in specs or code.<p>You don't want to be worried that if you have a conversation with a colleague about some problem which sparks an idea for a product that just the vague idea becomes company property.<p>Any of your ethereal ideas that your employer doesn't execute on should never be at risk of getting claimed later if you decide to do something with them.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It also depends on the job.  For a high-level executive position with a multi-million dollar golden parachute, sure a one or two year NCA is reasonable.  For example, iirc Mark Hurd had to wait a year for NCA to expire before going to work at Oracle after leaving HP.<p>But for a professional developer/engineer position for with minimum severance it's completely unreasonable.  It's like asking a lawyer to not practice law for a year after leaving a firm, or a doctor not to practice medicine for two years after leaving a partnership.  That's your bread &#38; butter, how you feed your children, and the idea of asking someone in that situation not to ply their hard-earned skills in their trade is nuts.<p>The only exception would be, and I personally agreed to this at my first job after graduating from college, is if the company provided an extensive training program that taught you all the skills you know.  My first company provided three months all-day classroom/lab training while paying us full wages, then an additional three months of mixed OTJ and classroom/training.  I was Econ grad and they taught us app development, and then asked us to sign a 1-year NCA that started on the date our training officially ended.  They just wanted to make sure they didn't make a huge investment training people (and paying them full salary during training) who would then jump over to a competitor right afterwards, which was totally reasonable.<p>Later, another company asked me to sign an NCA that would go into effect my last day of work with them, but offered no training, professional development, or year-long severance.  I and another new developer sat down with the CEO and explained the above, and she cancelled the whole program after realizing our side of it, which was very cool of her.<p>So yeah, it depends on the situation, type of employee, etc.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2489809 href="vote?for=2489809&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2489809></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mgkimsal">mgkimsal</a> 284 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2489809">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think this review is very valuable.  The key is to always look at it from the other persons point of view as well.  I like when an interviewee asks questions.  But there needs to be forethought and finnesse in the interaction.  Your questions are very telling of you, as are the questions the interviewer asks you, which can tell you a lot about them.  So, be sure to evaluate what your questions are "telling" this potential employer about you.  I'd rather get an offer an decline than not get an offer at all.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>On a recent engagement I prototyped a scalable content generation backend.  Technically, it is an extension of the Rails build-a-blog project that everyone does in a tutorial, and it is trivially within the reach of every other Rails developer with 4 years of experience.  The value I add above and beyond being able to implement a scalable content generation backend is a) knowing why you'd want to do it in the first place, b) creativity in applying it to whatever business is under discussion, c) being able to describe in detail what process one would need to use to use it in production, and d) being able to convince the relevant people that a + b + c = money.<p>Consulting engagements also have a number of risks associated with them.  Providing the perception of diminished risk is worth value to the client.  Many developers could implement A/B testing, for example.  (And they should, because it potentially prints money for the right clients.)  There are a variety of ways a hypothetical developer could cause a client to believe that an A/B testing engagement with them is less risky than it could be.  One is to have written a widely used A/B testing framework.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2486969 href="vote?for=2486969&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2486969></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pnathan">pnathan</a> 285 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2486969">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>See, that's the kicker.  You're able to see what the client needs, determine value and offer the best solution. As an independent business, you saw the benefit of that right away.  You got PAID!  That being said, does that really mean you're 10x better programmer than the next guy?  The entrepreneurial &#38; analytical mind may have made you just as valuable in the lumber business (yes, I know that's quite a stretch). 
The shortcoming of many companies in evaluating programmer performance is that Engineering/Development Managers are often making value judgements based on factors besides what you potentially bring to the company.  They're looking at how easy you make their job, how much they like you (seriously, I haven't even seen a manager completely detach their liking of someone and do an objective evaluation).
So, it boils down to, do you pay politics well, how smart do others "think" you are, and how well do you "sell" the value you bring to the company.  In some of the larger corporations, most of that doesn't matter all that much anyways.
If you're entrepreneurial, nothing will highlight your value quite like your own business!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2488855 href="vote?for=2488855&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2488855></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ataggart">ataggart</a> 284 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2488855">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I <i>didn't</i> implement the ERP system.  I enhanced the existing system to provide the benefits that the customer sought from the ERP systems.<p>What I really did was help the customer identify and attack their real problems without worrying about the technology at all.  They had business problems that they thought could only be solved with "bigger better software".  They were wrong (as many people are).<p>Some of their problems:<p><pre><code>  - inventory was inaccurate
  - product info (and bills of material) was inaccurate
  - too much inventory
  - too many late shipments to customers
  - shipping costs were too high
  - production was not efficient enough
</code></pre>
These are classic problems normally attacked with ERP software.  But their people were already doing the best the could with the tools at hand: old software and Excel.  The project had me work with their people on their problems, not on the software.  The solutions we proposed usually required more/better software, but not always.  Sometimes it was just a different policy or procedure (or a bi-lingual count sheet).<p>The exercise in attacking the problems at hand generated the software requirements that helped the customer solve those problems.  Mostly new forms, reports, database tables, and a few optimization workbenches and dashboards.  (One of my favorite programs was a simple tool that enabled a dispatcher to drag and drop loads into trucks, drap and drop trucks onto routes, and generate reports.  He "played" with this toy until he was satisfied with the best result.)<p>Hacking the customer's business was tricky.  Writing the software was trivial.<p>This goes back to one of OP's points: it's not about how many lines of code or how fast you can write them.  It's about providing value to help the customer solve their problem.  That's where the real money is.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2487094 href="vote?for=2487094&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2487094></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=r00fus">r00fus</a> 285 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2487094">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Just to add to the conversation:
Customization is 90% of the hard work of doing enterprise software.  Often enterprise software requires teams of folks to do the above, because what is required is<p>a) knowing the problems
b) knowing how to solve them (ie, coding/configuration)
c) being able to sell this to decision-makers<p>Those three roles often take more than one person to realize. Some folks are good at one of those, and they get paid well. Folks who do two or more well are rare/in-demand.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2486825 href="vote?for=2486825&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2486825></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jerhewet">jerhewet</a> 285 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2486825">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I had picked them up pretty much in the standard way as a referral from a friend to do maintenance programming on their legacy system.  They had me share an office with the Big 5 consultant who was interviewing ERP vendors.  I knew immediately that he had no idea what he was doing and would ultimately waste a lot of good people's time and money.  I had a lot of respect and loyalty to this customer and didn't want to see them taken advantage of.<p>I remember sitting up all night wondering what to do.  I decided to go to the CFO.  I told her that her Big 5 vendor didn't know what he was doing and gave her plenty of good examples.  I explained that after working with her software and her people for 3 months, I could come up with a more effective way of solving their problems in 10% of the time for 10% of the cost.<p>I half expected to be thrown out of her office, but instead, she got up, closed the door, and said, "Funny, I was thinking the same thing but didn't know what to do about it."  Together we laid out the plan and strategy for the project.<p>Ever since, I have never been bashful.  Even though proficiency and experience can carry you a long way, your biggest advancements often come when you go out on a limb to provide real value for a customer.<p>Another lesson: you never know what a gig can turn into, so just do your best and keep pushing that envelope.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2495180 href="vote?for=2495180&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2495180></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ajtaylor">ajtaylor</a> 283 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2495180">link</a></span></div><br>

Seriously, and for argument's sake, the "do whatever provides value" mantra is too simplistic and provides no value to entrepreneurs or engineers (or hybrid types) whatsoever. Let alone that it doesn't contradict to any of the "lame" stuff you listed.

I disagree.<p>In short I think good work in software and internet communications tools, like Tor, can actually have a profound effect on shaping government policy. (Tor is one of the darling s/w projects of the Swedish government.)<p>Slightly longer: I thought it was essentially impossible to influence government policy four or five years ago. I was interested in environmental issues and thought I would have to become a politician to be able to change things (heavens forbid). Then I fell into an opportunity where we started an open source software foundation to build online project, transparency, donation, visualisation tools for development aid.<p>Fast forward four years and we are working closely with the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Get invited to publicly review the work of the Swedish counterpart and sit in on bilateral talks between the USA and the Dutch on aid transparency. I see public policy change before my eyes. Of course, this is not only because something which we did, but we are at the right time and place with the right effort. However, I do know that our work changes the way policy is being shaped.<p>If you are curious to read more check out a couple of my blog posts:<p><a href="http://bjelkeman.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/law-is-hard-code-is-harder-why-new-internet-and-software-architecture-will-define-the-future-of-society/" rel="nofollow">http://bjelkeman.wordpress.com/2011/02/06/law-is-hard-code-i...</a><p><a href="http://wearefuturegov.com/2010/11/19/guest-post-where-open-data-leads-us/" rel="nofollow">http://wearefuturegov.com/2010/11/19/guest-post-where-open-d...</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2479619 href="vote?for=2479619&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2479619></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=petercooper">petercooper</a> 287 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2479619">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>So, as we have said before and will doubtless have to say again, Hacker News is a lousy forum for political teambuilding and logrolling. It's not designed for that, at all. So we discourage political discussions here.<p>There are actions one can take to defend one's civil liberties. Joining the ACLU and the EFF and sending them money. Writing letters to local and national political figures. Voting out people who don't care about civil liberties, and raising money for their opponents. Practicing civil disobedience. Organizing and contributing to effective protests. Many of these are praiseworthy things, productive things, but they are also exactly what we mean by "politics", and they're not what we do on Hacker News. They are what Facebook, mailing lists, political blogs, newspaper editorial pages and comment sections, and most of the rest of the web is for.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2479516 href="vote?for=2479516&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2479516></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jdp23">jdp23</a> 287 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2479516">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I agree with a couple of your points but I think you might be overreacting.<p>When the OP said to hang out at HN or learn all about the culture, that's really helpful for those who are completely unfamiliar with the whole industry. A lot of smart kids have never entered this world and it's a good primer. Just because they are new to startups doesn't make them hopeless -- I arrived a couple years ago and spent a few months just getting acquainted through tireless immersion.<p>Cold emails are fine, if they have an edge to them and are informed and targeted. If you get emails from people who clearly put there heart into writing it, I think it's at least worth a quick reply. You're not a celebrity.<p>And how else do you expect someone to get into the industry without some cold emails or calls? As someone who just got their foot in the door, I can definitively say one works at least twice as hard outside the industry than when one gets a job. Have some respect for that nonpaid effort, I say.<p>That said, one should always be building up a defined skillset concurrently.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2467958 href="vote?for=2467958&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2467958></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=edw519">edw519</a> 291 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2467958">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>I agree with a couple of your points but I think you might be overreacting.</i><p>You're probably right and if so, I apologize.  I guess it's just my way of venting my frustration with so many people talking when they should be listening.  To me, OP's post just seems like feeding fuel to that fire.<p>I would never want to discourage anyone from becoming part of our community.  It's just that some ways are much better than others.<p><i>And how else do you expect someone to get into the industry without some cold emails or calls?</i><p>Networking.  Better to get out there without an agenda, meet people, and grow.  Most of us would much rather meet someone and get to know them than to just delete another unsolicited email among hundreds of others.<p>Whether you email, network, or do something else, here's the most important thing: have something of value to offer, and offer it.  That will get you noticed.<p><i>That said, one should always be building up a defined skillset concurrently.</i><p>Definitely!  This never ends.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2467997 href="vote?for=2467997&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2467997></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jsavimbi">jsavimbi</a> 291 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2467997">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"Networking."<p>Absolutely right.<p>Do you know how hard it is to find good potential hires? It's really fucking hard, costly and time-consuming. If you think you're doing someone a favor by dropping off your resume at their job-fair booth, you've got some things to learn.<p>The best jobs are found via recommendation for a positions; better than that is to be recommended as a hire without there even being a position open with your specific skill or even a strategy in place on how to address that. Nobody is going to read your blog posts and come calling. (Unfortunately, some times they do for reasons unknown. Don't ask me why.)<p>The only way to do that is to get out there and execute on your ideas, make friends with as many people as you can, respect them and yourself and yes, network your ass off, even if you aren't looking for a job. Show some chuptzah, create demand around yourself and get them thinking that if they don't float an offer out to you, someone else will.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2468501 href="vote?for=2468501&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2468501></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nhangen">nhangen</a> 291 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2468501">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This sounds like a promising idea that executed well can be very successful.  I wish them great success.<p>Now that I got that out of the way, I hope I never go to a restaurant that has this.  Let me explain why...<p>Reread the first paragraph.  If you don't feel like back-clicking, here's the gist of it:<p><i>... the restaurant song-and-dance routine ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... “Check, please?” ... hand gesture ... furrow our brows ... mental math ... and, finally, get up to leave ... Whew.</i><p>Guess how many times I go to a restaurant with this kind of experience?  Once.  I won't go back.<p>In other words, the restaurants that can most benefit from this kind of service are exactly the ones <i>I don't want to eat at</i>...<p>We both work hard and eat most meals at home.  So when we go out, we want to be pampered.  In fact, we <i>insist</i> on it.  And I make it clear to my server every time we sit down with something like, "We've had a tough day and came here to relax with great food and service.  OK?"  In decent restaurants, most good servers see that as a challange and rise to the occasion.<p>I don't want to ever wait for <i>anything</i>.  I want a drink as soon as I sit down.  I want to discuss the menu with someone knowledgable.  I want time to eat my salad without the main course coming too soon.  I want my food to be delivered by my server, not some runner I've never seen before.  I don't want to be interrupted mid-sentence.  I want my server to be aware of my needs without being in my face.  If a restaurant does this, we will return over and over and tip much more than the standard 20%.  If they don't, we'd rather just eat at home.<p>I understand that the great masses of people don't feel this way and that's why E la Carte has so much potential.<p>But as for me, I've been looking at a screen all day long, so the last thing I want to do is order by terminal at Applebee's.  I rather pay $100 for one nice dinner per week than $25 for 4 lousy ones.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2464133 href="vote?for=2464133&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2464133></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kenjackson">kenjackson</a> 292 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2464133">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>In general I agree with you, but one feature to me would be worth the price of admission.  Instant check payment and leave.  Typically with kids, when we're done eating, we're done NOW.  We need to leave pronto.  Not in two minutes... now.<p>So the ability to simply say, "OK, dinner's over".  Hit a button and head out the door in five seconds would be great.  Probably not something you put in a five-star restaurant, but for family friendly restaurants its the type of thing that would make the difference on where we decide to go on a Wednesday night.<p>Also, I generally don't like waiters taking my credit card to process.  Could pay cash, but generally don't carry cash.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2464148 href="vote?for=2464148&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%47%33%58%79%69%56%56%65%7a%6a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2464148></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=hugh3">hugh3</a> 292 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2464148">link</a></span></div><br>

That's well over ten percent of most folks' take-home pay.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr style="height:10px"></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=14></td><td class="title"><a href="/x?fnid=qLck4ckM2h" rel="nofollow">More</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=10 width=0><table width="100%" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=1><tr><td bgcolor=#ff6600></td></tr></table><br>
