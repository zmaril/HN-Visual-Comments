I think this device would have the opposite effect that you hope for.  I wonder how many days you would last with it?<p>Multiply the number of talker_drivers you meet with the probability that one of them can't handle the extra distraction  of driving and banging on his cell phone, trying to reconnect his call that you jammed.  Imagine on a busy commute, this happening every two or three seconds.<p>Actually, this could be a murder mystery plot, on par with cutting the brake lines.  Hide a jammer in somebody's car, and wait for the inevitable result.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3134166 href="vote?for=3134166&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3134166></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=seclorum">seclorum</a> 108 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3134166">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Yes, they support multiple phones.  Check the Amazon link that portman provided.  It appears that all the major cordless manufacturers have sets that support this now.  It's been pleasant to use since it (I'm using a Uniden set) has "just worked" for me since day one.<p>I'm actually going to set this up for my elderly mother for Christmas who has a regular landline but also a "dumb" cellphone.  Her hearing is not that great so if the cellphone is not in her immediate proximity, she'll miss the call.  In this case, I'm just interested in the redundancy for phone service in case of emergencies.  It doesn't change how she will use the cordless phone at all but does provide us(her children) with more piece-of-mind.

The video mail system is pretty slick.  I bet my kid will have it figured out before he turns 3.<p>Key features for such an e-mail system:<p>- simple addressing.  In this case, just click on the picture for who you want to mail.<p>- a big fat "I'm done, send this!" button.<p>- email whitelist.  No spam, no scams, just people you personally know.<p>- new messages should either be read automatically, or you should get some sort of overlay every time you go into the app that says "you have new messages from [people]!  [BIG read now button] [smaller wait until later button]"  This way, grandma will always see her new messages.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3134664 href="vote?for=3134664&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3134664></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=narag">narag</a> 108 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3134664">link</a></span></div><br>

Other problems include keeping a file open for too long and leaking the fd.  An ideal computer has infinite space and no files.  A real one... nope :)<p>The advantage of functional programming languages is that you get to write <i>part</i> of your program as though you have an ideal lambda calculus evaluator.  But at some point, you still have to realize that there's a grey box under your desk that doesn't know what a lambda or fixed point is.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thanks for posting this. It takes a lot of balls (even with a throwaway account) to post something like this and, hopefully, only good will come out of it. If this thread goes like these kinds of threads usually go on Hacker News, I have no doubt you will have helped quite a few others with this. And hopefully, you will get help too. But that won't be easy. Here's why...<p>When I read your headline on the front page, the first thing I thought was, "OK, someone to help and encourage. Good." After I read your comment, I didn't feel quite the same way.<p>I normally try to be upbeat and positive, but in your case, it won't sound that way. I'm going to give it to you straight and I hope that you don't get offended or upset. You need feedback from my point of view.<p>It's perfectly normal for someone to be weak technically or with other people. It's perfectly normal for someone to struggle with work habits, project management, or personal issues. It's also perfectly normal for excellent people to have been fired. Many of us have been on both sides of these issues.<p>And these are the kinds of things that are easily managed and fixed.<p>Your issues, unfortunately, run deeper. Conflicts with bosses? OK, we've all been there. Not getting along? That happens, too. A negative assessment of your boss? Whoa. That would piss me off, too. Why didn't you just talk to him? Refusing to work on a project? WTF? That's your fucking job!<p>These are the kinds of things that are <i>not</i> easily managed and fixed. I don't know why anyone would take a chance on someone with this kind of track performance. I know that I wouldn't. I'd much rather hire a weak performer with good attitude and potential than a strong performer with interpersonal issues you describe. It's just not worth the trouble.<p>You most telling remark, however, was:<p><i>Another obstacle is that I'm an introvert loner and hence just the opposite of the "communicative teamplayer" companies seem to be looking for.</i><p>As one introvert loner to another, I can confidently tell you that this is just an excuse. Almost all of us are introvert loners and almost all employers want "communicative teamplayers". And most of us just find a way to make it work.<p>I bet I've been in situations like yours (and worse) far more times than you and I bet many others here have too. I've been abused more ways than I care to remember. I've done the work of 5 people and been passed up for promotion. I've worked overtime for years and got no credit. I've been yelled at, cussed at, and many times, generally treated like shit. But I've learned how to put up with it until it's no longer time to put up with it. It all depends where you draw the line.<p>I've never had words with a boss or customer. I've never emailed, talked about someone else, or filled out any form about them without <i>talking to them first</i>. And most of all, I've <i>never refused work</i>. That's our reason for being there in the first place.<p><i>Any ideas on how to get back into the working world with such a track record?</i><p>I may sound negative, but believe me, I really want to help. So here are a few thoughts:<p>1. The root cause of your negative experiences is probably still there. You need to identify that cause, understand your role, and fix it. Get help with that if you think you need it. The good news: you know there's a problem and you're already talking about it. You may be 90% of the way there.<p>2. Always tell the truth.<p>3. Don't be afraid to admit that you may have been wrong.<p>4. Be prepared to describe your experiences (truthfully always!) and what steps you have already taken to grow because of them.<p>5. Don't volunteer (in writing or in person) anything that you don't have to that can potentially hurt you.<p>6. <i>Never</i> give references until <i>after</i> you have a job offer (contingent upon those references).<p>7. Find a way to have a positive attitude and make it show.<p>8. Understand that there are assholes everywhere and you will surely encounter many more. You can't control them. But you must control yourself. Don't let them fuck you up any more.<p>I hope I haven't been too tough, but I think you needed to hear this. I wish you the best and look forward to hearing about you getting up on your feet again. If you want to refute anything I have said or need any follow-up feedback, please contact me off-line.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>But he did post here and he asked for input. So even if none of us would likely give the man/woman a chance based on their admitted attitude (and that's not what is being asked) the input is what matters.<p>And input like yours is exactly what might make the difference when he or she interacts with potential employers next time.<p>As a non-team player that manages to successfully fake it (within limits) I think that even that can be turned into an asset.<p>Refusing work that you are paid to do for is a firing offense all over the world. But circumstances do matter and since they're not provided I'm going to at least reserve judgment on whether or not there were any mitigating circumstances. For the record, I once refused to do a job that was technically within my abilities and job description. The only reason that job was given to me was as a revenge action for speaking up against a superior on an earlier occasion. Fortunately for me I had enough credit by then to be able to refuse the job and get away with it but technically that would have been the perfect pretext to fire me.<p>Growth is a process. Posts like these are part of that process, so I have plenty of hope that the OP will eventually manage to find his way, and improving on his communications skills would seem to be the first order of battle. Even saying 'no' is a sales job.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3130975 href="vote?for=3130975&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3130975></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=abbasmehdi">abbasmehdi</a> 109 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3130975">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You have to have good reason to fire an employee. There needs to be a paper trail of him not being able to do his job or him being generally insubordinate. The only thing that can legally get you fired on the spot is sexual harrasment or where you've broken the law in some manner that could affect the company.<p>Anyway you dont fit in to a regular command and control type organisation. Welcome to my world :) ....<p>Now if your generally a rebel but you do love creating things then you _might_ be an entrepreneur. First get a job and then view the job as the thing that allows you to become an entrepreneur in the future. Ie the job is your "Venture Capitalist". Save up enough so that you can quit in the future and go it on your own.<p>Again this means you have to put what you want before your urge to be right. This will take you about 3 years to learn. In 3 years you could have $50000 saved up and the oppurtunity of a lifetime to be an entrepreneur.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=400></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3147164 href="vote?for=3147164&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3147164></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=greenyoda">greenyoda</a> 105 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3147164">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I always chuckle when anyone says, "It's not too late to..."<p>It's never too late to do <i>anything</i>.<p>And it's never too late to get good at almost anything, especially programming.<p>My story:<p><pre><code>  Age 21 - graduated college
  Age 23 - graduated graduate school
  Age 24 - got my first job programming
  Age 24 - touched my first computer (that's right)
  Age 27 - touched my first personal computer
  Age 30 - purchased and set up my first personal computer
  Age 31 - wrote my first framework
  Age 32 - did my first start-up
  Age 36 - did my second start-up
  Age 46 - build my first web page
  Age 50? - wrote my millionth line of code
  Age never - got as good as I wanted to be
  Age always - loved it!
</code></pre>
A few other thoughts about OP:<p><i>Itâ€™s easy to think that itâ€™s too late, because look at those people who spent four years in college learning to code!</i><p>Don't look at anyone else. That's your problem. Just look at the problem at hand and your approach and solution. It's just you and your computer, mano-a-mano. Pretty primitive. That's when you stop worrying about the negatives and just go ahead and build something. And that's when you know nothing else really matters.<p><i>It is difficult!</i><p>Not really. Difficulty is relative. Start out by copying a "Hello World" program and getting it to run. Then add one new capability and get that to run. Then another. Then another. Always saving your last good version so that you can go back and start each step over, just in case you really fudge things up. Hey, you're programming! It wasn't that hard, was it?<p><i>I used to think I was cursed, because every time I tried to setup something new (new development environment, tool, library, etc), something would always go wrong.</i><p>There's a difference between systems administration (which all of this is) and programming. I hate the former (which I view as a necessary evil and takes 1% of my time) and love the latter (takes the other 99%).<p><i>Do you like it? ...do you feel a rush of excitement?</i><p>Yes! Nothing else I've ever done gives quite the same feeling as experiencing something I've built working for the first time ever. Happy dance!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3120642 href="vote?for=3120642&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3120642></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=simon">simon</a> 111 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3120642">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Yup. It's only too late if you don't want to do it in the first place.<p>While I started programming at 13, I didn't become a pastor until age 40.

It's a small congregation and I still have to work the day job as a programmer, but coming up on five years now and we are close to doubling the original size of the congregation (was just over twenty people).

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I too chuckle when I hear "not too late...".  Even more so when someone is in their 20's.<p>I began programming at age 36.  Shortly after, having been so inspired by how exciting it was, I enrolled in a university.  I am now just a few classes short of a Computer &#38; Information Science degree. I will be 40 when I have an actual degree in my hand.<p>What I can contribute to others from my experience is that you will have greater determination, focus, and perseverance to learn something you really enjoy.  This is especially true when you get older.<p>I don't believe I would have done as well or learned as much if I had pursued programming in my 20's.  I wasn't as focused; I had far too many distractions.<p>My advice on getting started.  Start at CS101. Learn the basics to a degree were it becomes second nature.  Solve small problems, when you can do that easily solve larger ones.  Don't cheat yourself; don't skim over bubble sort because it is boring, everything will teach you something.  And most of all, enjoy yourself.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3118670 href="vote?for=3118670&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3118670></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=edw519">edw519</a> 111 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3118670">link</a> | <a href="item?id=3118452">parent</a> | on: <a href="item?id=3118452">Ask HN: Is it improper to invite ex-coworkers to j...</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Story of my life, Ed.  I am your poster boy who lives "cheap" and not "frugal" by choice.  I clip coupons and browse slickdeals before committing to a purchase.  I never buy anything at MSRP.  I monitor airfare prices for weeks before booking a ticket.<p>This is a difficult problem to escape because it's one that <i>I behaved myself into</i>, and that it's self-reinforcing for a variety of reasons:<p>- When you're already on a fixed salary, the opportunity cost of spending time on being cheap is not obvious.  You're not taking time away from that $500/hr side consulting gig that you don't have.  Instead, you're at a situation where the marginal rate of return on clipping coupons (say, $10/hr) is significantly better than spending the next hour working on that iPhone app that is months from release and has no interested buyers (how long is it going to take to recoup the Apple developer fee?).<p>- Some people get a rush out of saving money, a feeling of <i>"Ha! I beat the system."</i>  To them, saving money is a form of entertainment [1], and there's certainly far worse hobbies to have from a well-being perspective.  Unfortunately, there are people who take this too far and end up as total misers or compulsive hoarders.  I'm not a pathological case, but I've done things that would make some people cringe.<p>- Seeing people successfully live frugally can be a motivator to follow in their path.  My parents are immigrants who worked hard and saved for 20 years before they were finally able to afford a house in an expensive neighborhood (and nearly paid for it all in cash).  They drive Toyotas, shop at Costco, and cook at home.  They are basically the epitome of the "millionaire next door" [2].<p>- There's also a moral justification for this.  <i>"Why do I have to keep up with my spendthrift neighbors?  So what if I don't drive a Maserati or carry a HermÃ¨s bag?  No thanks, I shall be comfortable in my own skin, since envy and greed are evil."</i>  This is now an identity statement [3], and while it's a good position to take from a financial perspective, it can be crippling in the way it makes some people closed-minded.  Of course, this doesn't necessarily stop them from pontificating about retirement at 30.<p>I do still think that my years of being cheap are starting to pay off, mostly because I'm finally getting comfortable with the sort of "discretionary" expenses you mentioned in your post.  The difference is that it probably took a much larger bank balance for me to consider them "affordable."  I just flew across the continent purely on a whim to visit some friends that I hadn't seen in years, I no longer cringe at expensive bar tabs if they were time well spent with buddies, I can afford to make an impulse electronics purchase just to see what it's like, and I'm preparing for that self-funded sabbatical [4] to reboot my life.<p>Was it worth it?  Well, it was really, really hard to re-orient myself this way, and it took much more sacrifice than necessary, but the good news is that aside from lost time, most of the rest hopefully can be recovered.<p>[1] <a href="http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/2009/08/saving-money-trumps-sex/" rel="nofollow">http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/2009/08/saving-money-trumps-se...</a><p>[2] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Thomas-Stanley/dp/0671015206" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Thomas-Stanley/d...</a><p>[3] <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html</a><p>[4] <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000076.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000076.html</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3119201 href="vote?for=3119201&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3119201></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kamaal">kamaal</a> 111 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3119201">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Well I would say that savings driven life is far better than the spendthrift side of things. Now this is purely personal choice. No denying.<p>In my case I like to sit on piles of cash, without any debts and EMI's to pay. And loan interests to worry about. I like to live a tension free life at the same time get a realization that I'm getting rich. And if you do so, you actually see that a lot of luxuries come a little late, but they come at zero stress, worries and hassles to worry about. The lateness in affording things is often very differential and in my case at least has made very little difference. Over the years you are far better off having money, peace and tranquility in your life even if you drive the Mercedes two years late. Than having a Mercedes right now and all the while paying off debts endlessly in cycles(Home, Credit card etc).<p>Now the point is simple, I don't really understand the spend thrift part of the world. Just because I don't dine at a seven star hotel eating a sever course meal, I doesn't mean I'm not eating well. I eat whatever I like, drink whatever I like and wear whatever I like. I just don't fall for the brands and buy 1 get two free kinda stuff.<p>I can go with the same phone for some years provided that server the job for the moment. Which most of the times it does. I don't see any reason to have credit card(Yes I don't have a credit card at all). Its just if you don't succumb to peer pressure and blindly imitating others spending patterns. You sort of can end up saving really lots of money. With savings and investments you can really end up making a lot after a while.<p>And then you can buy everything your want, retire early. Buy your dream home and live well.<p>In fact this is more pleasurable than the other approach.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3119629 href="vote?for=3119629&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3119629></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=hessenwolf">hessenwolf</a> 111 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3119629">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Debt is a dangerous thing. I don't think the same about governments. But I consider debt to be disastrous for individuals.<p>The reason is simple a lot of your work, time and energy drains into paying the most scary thing invented by finance industry so far - 'Compound Interest'. This is especially dangerous in the case of credit card. The debt keeps mounting because of two reason, you being unable to pay and yet still continuing to borrow money. This sort of a spending patters brings a lot of pain to people every where.<p>And all of this for what? Upgrading from iPhone 4 to iPhone 4s. Is this really worth?<p>In this sort of set up people living with a savings driven life get a automatic lead ahead of spendings driven people.<p>Because while you are working to pay off the interest money. He works for the same time and saves that interest money.<p>I think it will be safe to say to say that if your paying X% money as interest to bank by working for hours Y(Remember you are loosing X% money, thereby in effect rendering your Y hours of work useless, as though it never happenned). The same X% is the money earned by the savings driven guy in the same Y hours(Additional to the money he is already earning. So this his extra income).<p>You work to loose money and he works to get rich. Although both work for the same time. One gets richer other gets poorer. This is how bad debt can inflict suffering on you.<p>These days you can be relatively rich by just saving money!

Clipping coupons can pay 1000$ an hour or 1.5$ an hour but the important thing is not just ROI but how much you like or dislike doing things.  But with stuff there is a third option. I don't listen to music so the cost of a CD or concert ticket is irrelevant to me.  I don't like to travel so the cost of a plane ticket is irrelevant, I don't like posters, nick nacks, or buying clothes so most stores simply don't have anything I want to buy.<p>So, when you see someone that saves most of their money don't assume they are hording it, some people just don't find all that many things they want to trade it for at a price they are willing to pay.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think it was a post on HN awhile back that got me thinking like this. If I don't want to do it, and the opportunity cost for me is greater than the cost to hire someone else to do it, then I should just pay them. The key here is the opportunity cost is <i>for me</i>, not for anyone else. For example, I hate mowing the lawn and I estimate I'd have to be paid well over $100 to get me to "enjoy" doing it. Thus, I pay the $60 for lawn service. To me, I just earned $40 of my time back. Now, I'll admit, it isn't as cost effective as being cheap or "frugal", but I do think I enjoy life a bit more.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3117447 href="vote?for=3117447&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3117447></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=webwright">webwright</a> 112 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3117447">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>At this point, investing capital in real estate and stock markets is a fool's errand. They're done. Maybe they're okay as a savings vehicle (maybe!), but you should not realistically expect to make more than 2-3% returns after accounting for inflation, fees, taxes, and time spent on them. And, no, you're not going to be able to consistently outperform people who specialize full time in those kinds of investments and who have access to insider information.<p>The real trick is to invest in something you do have access to insider information about and that you do do full time: being yourself. Invest in human capital, aside from a financial baseline to diversify for when your human capital starts to rapidly depreciate.<p>In some ways this is cheap. Reject certifications besides the most basic (a degree). Focus on getting an education instead. Buying a top of the line computer, high speed internet access, and books to learn from, for developers, is an almost negligible expense that will go a long way. And the most valuable way to learn--creating useful projects--can more than pay for themselves.<p>In other ways this is expensive, though. Choosing to invest in a 401k* takes an hour or two of your life per year, while investing in yourself is at least one or two hours a day. This is very, very expensive if you're already spending 50 hours a week sitting at a computer pounding away at brain-deadening code. (On the other hand, if you can get paid while also increasing your human capital... you've hit gold. Stay there until you've stopped rapidly learning, and then jump to the next big thing.)<p>Key point, though: there are multiple areas you have to invest in. Yes, a professional skill like coding is useful. But who knows what it'll be like in 5 or 10 years? Make sure to put time into your relationships, your physical health, your non-coding hobbies (drawing, banjo, typography, whatever). This diversification exposes you to more long-term investments: they help you maximize your luck surface area and will come in handy surprisingly frequently down the line.<p>How do all these retire-at-30 articles fit in? They aim to maximize financial investments early on by under-investing in many categories of self-capital, hopefully catching a good bull market, and rapidly switching to building self capital at 30. The obvious flaw is the assumption of outsized returns--they're not going to be as big as hoped--but that can be dealt with by tinkering with the numbers a bit.<p>The more fundamental issue is that it's not diversifying. It's risky. If you've saved up 500k by 30 by working long hours and frugally cutting coupons on your time off, that's nice, and if things work out right you might be fine. But suppose the defaulting of some government thousands of miles away sets off a chain reaction of bank failures that ends up massively contracting the economy you live in. There goes most of your savings. Yes, you might have invested in bonds, but you wouldn't have been pulling in those massive returns you were banking on to retire so early. And your job, having been funded by massive amounts of loose capital, suddenly disappears. Oh, you're farked, and you'll have to start nearly from scratch again after the economy recovers. Back to giving up your weekends to the whims of an MBA. (If anyone's willing to hire an expensive 35-year-old developer when there are all these recent college grads willing to work like dogs so they can retire at 30.)<p>Or even simpler: you hand in your resignation on your 30th birthday, walk out the door, and are hit by a semi driven by some overworked and drugged up trucker. Wow, that sucks. At least all those hard-earned dollars will go to some charity or another.<p>The ideal, I think, is to semi-retire as soon as you can, and work 15 to 20 hours a week at jobs you find interesting or fun. You get the best of both worlds and have diluted the amount of risk you face at any one time.<p>*Controversial statement here: 401k's are the biggest scam alive today, you're not only freezing your capital but also betting on taxes being lower in the future than they are today.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3118403 href="vote?for=3118403&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3118403></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ryanwaggoner">ryanwaggoner</a> 112 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3118403">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Saying that real estate and stock markets are "done" is ridiculous. I don't know where you got the 2-3% return expectation from, but outperforming professional investors need not be the goal. Independent (retail) investors can generate sufficient market returns to live a very comfortable retirement without having to be disappointed that they're not the next Warren Buffett.<p>To your point, investing in human capital (yourself) is valuable -- but it's not enough. The problem is it doesn't scale. If your biggest asset is yourself, your biggest income is going to be from each additional hour you work. If you invest in other assets (real estate, companies, whatever) you can generate passive income without having to work.<p>I agree with your controversial statement about 401K's, not just from the future tax prediction standpoint, but also from the perspective of limiting your investment options.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3120820 href="vote?for=3120820&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3120820></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pja">pja</a> 111 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3120820">link</a></span></div><br>

I couldn't disagree with this more. In fact, I find the opposite true. Living lightly and investing well <i>on average</i> creates much greater opportunity and enjoyment than indiscriminate spending.<p>Sure, some wealth comes with being cheap/frugal. But real wealth comes from investing your time &#38; money well and spending intelligently. Notice I said "time &#38; money". Discretionary items are just as much a time sink as they are a money sink.<p>Forget the self-help articles that harp on about minimalism and the latest lifestyle design fads. Try to live lightly and gauge the results for yourself. You won't miss anything, you'll have more time, you'll think clearer, and of course you'll have more money.<p>Then you'll decide to launch a startup and lose your mind :)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3117670 href="vote?for=3117670&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3117670></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=TDL">TDL</a> 112 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3117670">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I've found it's not that hard to balance frugality with, well, spending money.  They can actually work quite well together. So while most of my wardrobe is still acquired from thrift-shops, I also bought my most recent car without taking out a loan. I liked not having car payments, but needed a new car for a road trip we're taking next year, so I tuned my budget and saved cash to buy a car outright.<p>Just because you're frugal doesn't mean you can't have nice things. My wife just bought me a $600 leather jacket (that I've admittedly been too frugal to pull the trigger on) -- for $450, new, via eBay. My 10 year old set of Sennheisers were showing their age, so I bought HD595s. MRSP $329, Craigslist price? $100, new in the box. My other car's radiator was shot - and if I can develop loan disbursement software and ecommerce stuff, surely I can handle changing the radiator in my car, and did, saving myself hundreds of dollars. And these are just things I buy, not even going into the stuff I do.<p>On that last one though, there is definitely a balance you have to find between doing stuff yourself and better spending your time. My father would always wash his own car, but I can drive two blocks and spend $20 to have 8 guys and a giant machine wash it more quickly, and I'll pay someone else to change the oil.<p>In short, I think that your idea that "you'll probably be stuck that way for life" is absurd, and you're mistakenly mixing up the terms frugal and cheap.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3117374 href="vote?for=3117374&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3117374></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=timr">timr</a> 112 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3117374">link</a></span></div><br>

Life is too short to spend part of a weekend day (or more) changing a radiator.  Much better to pay someone skilled at radiator replacement to make the problem go away (or in my case, to outsource the problem of owning a vehicle to Zipcar).<p>More generally, the older I get, the more stuff I try to outsource in an effort to viciously guard my spare time.  Sometimes it feels a bit bourgoise (e.g. am I really so important that I'd pay someone to clean my apartment?) but it definitely helps to be able to put a dollar value on each hour of your life, and answer the question <i>"would I pay someone $X an hour to do this?"</i>  If the answer is no, it's probably better to outsource.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3117596 href="vote?for=3117596&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3117596></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=burgerbrain">burgerbrain</a> 112 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3117596">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Ah, I thought I addressed that when I mentioned that I don't wash my own car. I don't do my own oil changes either.<p>The last decade of my life has been incredibly busy. It's nice to take a half hour and mow the lawn, or walk to Pep Boys, chat with the folks behind the counter, walk home with a radiator, and spend an hour figuring how to replace the old one without spilling coolant all over the driveway.<p>With all the coding I do, there's a satisfaction I get out of physical assembly and creation in things like home renovation or working on my car that doesn't, for me, ever feel the same coming from an LCD screen. Wiring up a three-way switch on both ends of a light bulb, throwing the breaker back on and having it work the first time, or buying a "broken" drum machine, opening it up and soldering the power connector back on, or tuck-pointing the stone foundation in my house.<p>I agree that spare time seems more and more fleeting as the years pass by. And though I'm sure there are interesting things for which you're saving your time, your not having mentioned them reminds me of a poem by Ogden Nash, "The Strange Case of Mr. Artesian's Conscientiousness" which Google shows me is quoted in full at <a href="http://www.paceadvantage.com/forum/showthread.php?t=69657&#38;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.paceadvantage.com/forum/showthread.php?t=69657&#3...</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3118128 href="vote?for=3118128&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3118128></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=gridspy">gridspy</a> 112 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3118128">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I live, by most comparisons to people within the same bracket, very cheaply.  The thing is, I'm not watching every penny, I'm not buying the cheapest thing there is.  I just refuse to pay more than what I value something at (and dollars, not intrinsic value of the time).  There's some things that are significantly under what I would value them at dollar wise and have no trouble paying for, but there's a large number of things that are priced over what I would value them at and just don't buy them.  Additionally, the immediate price isn't the only thing to consider in the cost, there's the lifetime value of the item as well.  So, I would disagree that the sole response is being cheap, I'm completely confident the same things are capable of being accomplished by having an understanding of the total cost and total value of things you're spending money on and being smart about purchases and use of money rather than buying expensive things because they're "nice".</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3117343 href="vote?for=3117343&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3117343></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mailanay">mailanay</a> 112 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3117343">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>A programmerâ€™s greatest enemy is getting stuck.</i><p>Agreed. I often know where I want to go but can't seem to get there with code. This sucks and good programmers must find a way to get through this.<p><i>A crucial skill in programming...is the ability to recognize when theyâ€™re stuck,</i><p>Yes, and this is the only time I ever measure lines of code. Here is my metric: If I've been sitting at my computer (developing, not testing or anything else) more than one hour and LOC written or changed = 0, then I'm officially stuck, and must move to GettingUnstuck mode.<p><i>to get out of being stuck,</i><p>The most effective way I've ever found to get unstuck is to <i>get away from the computer</i>. I take pencils, paper, and code listings and get away, always into another room, sometimes to another building.<p>I have learned that the reason I'm stuck is not because I don't know how to do something; it's because I don't know <i>what to do</i>.  <i>What</i> needs to be determined away from the computer; <i>how</i> can be determined at the computer.<p><i>and to avoid getting stuck in the first place.</i><p>This is the one time I disagree with OP. Getting stuck is not the problem; getting unstuck is. If you're not getting stuck on a regular basis, then you're probably not working on big enough problems.<p>Never getting stuck makes programming like almost any other vocation. For me, getting stuck and then getting unstuck and making something cool work for the first time ever is one of the best feelings you can have.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3115014 href="vote?for=3115014&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3115014></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=0x12">0x12</a> 113 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3115014">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>My trick for getting unstuck is to start maintenance on the part where I'm stuck. Any kind of cleanup, comment clarification and so on will do. Once I'm doing that I'm doing something and moving from doing something to doing what I want to do happens more or less automatic at some point.<p>I got this trick from working in a metal shop. We'd get stuck trying to solve a problem all the time, and whenever that happened we'd simply start cleaning up. Usually after cleaning up the 'way forward' was crystal clear.<p>Now, of course one day there will be a problem where this will not work but for now it seems like a really good trick.<p>The underlying mechanism is as far as I can see related to being stuck in the same cycle in your head. As soon as you start cleaning up you force yourself to look at the forest instead of the individual trees and that's where you'll find the key for moving on.<p>ymmv, it works for me.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3116719 href="vote?for=3116719&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%74%31%4c%65%42%53%69%72%5a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3116719></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=5hoom">5hoom</a> 112 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3116719">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Great post, Jacques. Thanks for your kind words.<p><i>People might even consider doing business with you, but nobody wants to be 'first' for fear of being burned.</i><p>This can also work in your favor...<p>It's rare, but sometimes you can find someone who <i>does</i> want to be your first customer. When this happens, it's solid gold and one of your fastest shortcuts. Others call them "champions"; I prefer "sugar daddies".<p>I have had this happen several times with great success. This is how it usually worked...<p>Sometimes they knew me, but sometimes I was introduced. In every case, they were desperately looking for something they couldn't find, sometimes for years. They would say, "If you could build this, you'd be my hero." (or something like that). They have offered me office space, access to their people and systems, and often an advance because it was in everyone's best interest that I'd succeed. Sometimes, but not always, they wanted equity. And all of them had peers with similar problems, so Prospects 2 thru x were already lined up.<p>We should all be building stuff people want. When you find one of them with their checkbook open, take a good hard look.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You bring up something I failed to mention: this can be a touchy situation. In your case, it sounds like you have a great customer, but not a sugar daddy. I would never do something to upset a current customer.<p>You could make them a partner so that they can make a little extra money selling the clever solution they conceived, but that's really hard to do at the enterprise level. That works much better with a small business alpha male owner.<p>Some of the things to consider when taking your sugar daddy's solution to market:<p>Are they enterprise? If so, this probably isn't worth the trouble. Too much red tape and illogical thinking.<p>Does the solution provide them with a distinctive advantage over their competitors? If so, it only makes sense that they'd want to keep it for themselves. If not, they may gain favors among their peers by sharing it.<p>Is is a horizontal solution? Then there's really not much of a competitive threat by sharing it.<p>How opportunistic are they? Some people want to be sugar daddies because they're jealous of our IT margins. They can make as much sharing their technology as they do in their primary business.<p>Does wider use of the technology help their primary business?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>That's some good advice.<p>But, don't forget with enterprise customers you can offer to sell the company to them.  2-20 million for a long term strategic advantage plus your proven track record can be seen as net win for everyone.
