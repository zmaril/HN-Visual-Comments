<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>PG, what probability would you assign to the propositions "This time things are different" (empirically: the jobs won't come back 5 years from now) vs. "This time things are not different" (empirically: the jobs will come back 5 years from now)?  Warning, if your probabilities are extreme enough, someone might want to bet you on it.<p>Presuming things are different, I see five obvious answers to the original question (and "all of the above" is also an option).<p>1)  The amount of regulation and regulatory burden has increased sufficiently between then and now, that new business relationships have a much harder time replacing old destroyed business relationships.  I.e., it's now more expensive to hire a new employee.<p>2)  It's a novel change in the financial side of the economy.  Like, capital-holders now try to make killings by investing in the right HFT funds instead of trying to go out and invest in new businesses.  Implausible?  Maybe, but finance <i>has</i> changed a lot recently, so the difference, if there is one, might be there.<p>3)  The amount of re-education required to get a new job has increased enough to be a killer barrier to re-employment, whether because of employers having imposed an arbitrary demand for bachelors' degrees or because the jobs are actually more complex.<p>4)  Ricardo's Law does allow individual regions to lose as a result of tech improvements, because if someone else beats your comparative advantage, people will want to trade with them instead of you.  There's nothing ahistorical about the Rust Belt having a persistent recession within the US.  This is now happening to the whole US; people no longer want to trade with us, but China is growing plenty.<p>5)  The Thiel hypothesis:  Recent technological developments are intrinsically more boring than past technological developments; people are trying to build web apps that will sell to Google for $10 million instead of trying to invent the next "microchip" or "electricity".  It's not that the 21st century poses a novel obstacle to forming new business relationships to replace old ones; rather, 21st-century technologies that obsolete jobs are missing a wow factor or wealth-generating factor that previously increased demand or increased total wealth at the same time as obsoleting jobs.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2852191 href="vote?for=2852191&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2852191></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dxbydt">dxbydt</a> 183 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2852191">link</a></span></div><br>

We keep getting "we're at [or passed] peak oil" but then a new oil field or new extraction method makes this seem less likely. Thing is that oil will run out.<p>To me technological changes haven't converted in to less jobs because we've exploited those changes to increase resource use, and hence production. As natural resources falter then we can no longer have the increased resource use and so the removal of jobs via technological improvements can't be mitigated by the addition of jobs in new areas.<p>There are various resource pressures and financial problems that suggest to me that we're at the turning point. It would be nice to be wrong about that in some ways.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2855319 href="vote?for=2855319&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2855319></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rayiner">rayiner</a> 181 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2855319">link</a></span></div><br>

The American currency trades at roughly +25% worldwide due to stability/prestige, and the recent administrations are really doing all they can to undermine both of those. So, American could net lose jobs and net lose GDP (implausible, but possible). But worldwide? Massive increases.<p>So anyways, what odds on what proposition are you looking for, and what timeline?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Environment plays a huge role in the development and maintenance of IQ. And socioeconomic status (SES) can greatly affect the conduciveness of a child's environment to fostering IQ development. Accordingly, since more and more children are being born into low-SES households, it isn't surprising to see average IQ scores in decline.<p>Consider the following tidbit from the most recent national census: 50% of all babies born in the country right now are born into low-SES households (as defined as households dependent on governmental assistance, like food stamps). Forty-one percent of all babies born in the country are born to unmarried mothers (single-mother households being highly correlated with low SES).<p>The conclusion isn't that our generations are getting dumber, <i>per se</i>; it's that our generations are being born into poorer and poorer households. And the deck is pretty significantly stacked against someone born into a low-SES household.<p>Now, there's debate about causality in all of this, i.e., whether the existing population is actually getting poorer, or whether the poor are simply outbreeding the well-off. Based on census data, it seems to be a little of column A, and perhaps a bit more of column B. Either way, the younger generations are starting off on worse footing. And that leads to lower IQ scores <i>and</i> decreased future prospects.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2885693 href="vote?for=2885693&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2885693></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=MissBridgit">MissBridgit</a> 173 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2885693">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Have to say something.  Using statistics to quantify a change in IQ based SES is similar to using statistics to show that an algae bloom is due to increased sunlight only.  The drop in IQ has more to do with limiting educational opportunities and community supports for struggling families.  Yes, our government has let us down in many ways but it is a generational problem of trying to give the people what they need to survive and be successful without the people really understanding what it truly is, to be successful.  Mass media promotes an idea of success that is NOT successful in terms of true human success and the average Joe buys into such fallacies.  It should never be a handout but a hand up to a better life, short term, look for solutions, educate, change, move on.  If that is not possible for a "family" to do this, it needs to be discovered specifically why, not just surface appearances of what may truly be stopping appropriate growth and development of the human being.  It is never one thing only, there is always a system involved and the system is broken somewhere along the way preventing it from working entirely successfully. Who said it takes a VIllage?  It really does, a whole village of people concentrated on the development of each individual within that village to ultimate success and success does not equal money or power unless it is a means to an end for change and a better future for all.
1. topnotch prenatal care for all
2. topnotch education and services from birth, identifying potential problems in development right from the start and providing supports to prevent issues
3. Proper diet and nutrition education and availability, across the board
4. Fewer identifiers of low SES on a daily basis for growing children to prevent the stigma from pushing them into poor decision making.
5. A village for every child<p>It is all out there, you have to fight for it sometimes and sometimes you are treated with suspicion just because you want to fight for it, but in the end, it will always be worth it, for posterity's sake.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2853051 href="vote?for=2853051&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2853051></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=lsc">lsc</a> 182 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2853051">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>So far in the 20min discussion, I like this answer best as it tries to outline the factors for even a crude estimation.  I do have another variable to add that nobody has mentioned.<p>I think the sentiment, not explicitly conveyed in the article, is that "there are less jobs <i>for the number of employable people</i>".  And there lies the rub.  Perhaps net total jobs is still on the rise, but the rate of population growth is that much faster than the rate of jobs created.  And it's not flat rates, but changing rates as well.  When technology provides efficiency (I'm thinking scale, atm), it would probably push rate of jobs create slightly lower.  With more people on the planet, instead of competing with 1 other person for 1 spot, a person might be competing with 10 other people for 2 spots, hence the sense of joblessness, and a culprit to blame.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2852385 href="vote?for=2852385&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2852385></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=cpeterso">cpeterso</a> 182 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2852385">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; we've been through this many times before<p>'past predicts future' is not exactly commensurate with a point of inflection. perhaps a real-life example can help - a medical transcription firm in India hires 25 Indians to transcribe medical records. I then sell the CEO a copy of voice recognition software. He is so happy with the results, he fires 24 and keeps 1 Indian to fix the occasional transcription typos! After one month, he finds the transcription error rate is unacceptably high, so he hires one more Indian to fix typos. For the past 1 year, these 2 Indians &#38; that software has chugged along, making money. Now that CEO is happy, making money, and has opened his second office in India, with another copy of the software &#38; just 2 more Indians to babysit and bugfix! True story. Any way you cut it, that's net job loss. First, a bunch of housewives in Atlanta who transcribed for a living lost their livelihood, but you can rationalize that by saying, hey atleast 25 Indians got hired. But 23 out of those 25 Indians lost jobs &#38; 1 piece of software ended up doing the job! Now unless the Atlanta housewives and the 23 Indians end up working for the voice recognition software company ( a very remote possibility ) or end up in a brand new job ( even more remote possibility ) given their limited skills, there is definitely a block of time when there is net job loss.
Ofcourse eventually some of these people will learn new skills and/or are absorbed into new jobs etc...atleast, that's the hope. But the intervening reality can't be wished away. I still think this story will have a happy ending, but so far I don't see it.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2852221 href="vote?for=2852221&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2852221></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=achompas">achompas</a> 183 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2852221">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Frictional unemployment is a good way to handwave away the discovery, or not, of new jobs. You just wiped out that whole -type- of job, replaced it with (much lower employment) error checking.<p>If you assume that for a portion of the people in the transcribing job, that the transcribing job was the best marginal fit, then some of them don't re-enter the job market. Others have to take a worse job. If they could have been in a better job, they likely would have been. So their employment has gotten worse.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>If they could have been in a better job, they likely would have been.</i><p>There are a number of reasons this is not the case. I'd wager that a main reason is "re-training takes too much time." If a worker gets laid off, gets his Associate's, and starts something new, well, that's a net positive scenario. He or she produces output in a new field, while the transcription software replaces their old output. Net positive outcome.<p>You call it "handwaving," but the above happens to many people.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>One answer, and I don't know if this is the right answer, is that unlike in previous revolutions, a new class of jobs has not been created to (fully) replace the jobs that are being displaced. In the industrial revolution, farmers could move to the city and get a job in the factory. In the (first) information revolution, factory workers could become telephone operators. But as Tyler Cowen notes in "The Great Stagnation," jobs in the software industry are relatively few compared to the number of jobs that are being eliminated in other fields. It's unclear what new class of jobs would fully compensate for the loss of, say, many unskilled labor jobs to automation.<p>A second answer might be that we're only now fully realizing the effects of globalization -- outsourcing, moving factories to China, call centers to India, etc... due to the advances in telecommunications and whatnot. Perhaps there was an underlying structural shift as early as the 90's, but we were coasting on the housing boom. I recognize that that's a rather hand-wavey argument.

Similar basic economic structures get replicated in many diverse geographic locations.

How many are ever going to be more than an office in the Valley or NYC and maybe a few sales outposts?

Sure.<p>These things take time, and the progress may seem slow to many of us, but massive infrastructure changes cannot be accomplished quickly.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Probably it is not happening now, but it should happen in a few years.<p>Historically technology has displaced humans, but there has always been something that is cheaper to retrain humans for than it is to build machines for.  For one thing you can explain to humans what to do, and they could turn an incredible amount of computing power to figuring out, following, and filling out your instructions.  Computers simply have not had anything close to a human brain.<p>However as the complexity of our machines goes up, and the costs of automation go down, eventually we'll come to a point where it is cheaper to design and build a machine for a new job than it is to train someone to do it.  At that point humans will be displaced and new jobs won't show up for it.<p>By a back of the envelope estimate, we're perhaps 10-15 years away from having computers with the raw computational power of a human brain.  Software will follow, and the successes of things like Watson suggest that it won't take that long for software to catch up enough to be economically useful.<p>Once it is possible to train a machine faster than a human, the cost of buying and running that machine puts a cap on what that human can expect to be paid.  Given Moore's law, that cap will descend painfully quickly after it first becomes an issue.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2852456 href="vote?for=2852456&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2852456></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=cpeterso">cpeterso</a> 182 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2852456">link</a></span></div><br>

I think this learning time is fluid. It could be a function of cultural expectation of self reliance, for example.<p>What is funny is that plenty of roboticists point to an inflection point in the future when service jobs become displaced, which will dwarf these problems.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"Our new economy is shrinking because technology leads to efficiency over growth."<p>I disagree with this premise.  IMHO, it is much simpler: we as individuals lived beyond our means for 20+ years by borrowing money against our houses and against our personal word (e.g. credit cards).  We as governments lived beyond our means in terms of direct spending as well future spending promises (e.g. promising retirement/pension/medical benefits that are funded by borrowing or not funded at all).  Big companies also promised retirement (pension) benefits that assumed a continuing growth of the investments that backed the pensions - that didn't work out so well.<p>"But why now, when it hasn't in the past?"<p>In the past, we relied on general growth exceeding our indebtedness, "growing" our way out of our debt.  This is a game that cannot go on forever... and the longer it goes on, the worse the crash will be at the end.  Right now, it is looking pretty tough.<p>In short, we lived beyond our means for 20+ years.  We will have to live "below our means" for a substantial number of years to balance our past spending against our current and future incomes... and that assumes we have the will to make the hard decisions to truly reduce our spending rather than claiming to reduce spending, but the "reductions" are 2/5/10 years in the future.<p>A big part of living "below our means" is buying less, paying down our debt, which means lower demand and thus lower job levels.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2852201 href="vote?for=2852201&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2852201></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=josh33">josh33</a> 183 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2852201">link</a></span></div><br>

Experts think this could happen anywhere between 2015 and 2020. When that pops, the housing bubble will look minuscule.<p>The prudent should prepare now. Buy food storage. Become self reliant. And get out of debt!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2855345 href="vote?for=2855345&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2855345></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=wallflower">wallflower</a> 181 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2855345">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Jarvis here.... (that's my quote)....<p>I'm not sure; that's what I want to explore.<p>But I think the scale enabled by the net creates such profound efficiency and disintermediation. craig newmark sees himself as a philanthropist of classifieds; his (estimated) $100m business helped disrupt more than $13b in classified revenue. The funds are a dividend for the transactors so the value is not gone, but jobs are.<p>Look, too, to Clay Shirky's cognitive surplus. In the comments on this post at Google+, Eric Reasons brought up entertainment as an example. They get a double whammy. The people formerly known as the audience (TM Jay Rosen) now have more ways to entertain/distract themselves and can "consume" less entertainment. They also can make more entertainment, ending the scarcity and providing no end of free competition to the industry. There will be much more entertainment, but fewer jobs from it.<p>Look at retail. Practical necessity required there to be brick-and-mortar stores with much inventory and sales staff across the country as a channel of fulfillment. No more. RIP Borders. Now it is much more efficient, of course, to consolidate and fulfill commodity goods at a distance. Thank you, Amazon. Again, fewer jobs, which won't be replaced.<p>Transparent pricing in the market will lower prices and reduce the ability of retailers to benefit from pricing opacity. More efficiency. Less profit. Fewer jobs.<p>Even in my "trade," education, we know what's coming: open courseware will replace third-rate lectures.<p>Yes, I'm well aware that say, in the shift from agrarian to industrial economies, efficiency shifted jobs from farms (greater efficiency) to factories (greater wealth). The factory equivalents today -- startups -- create great wealth but with fewer jobs.<p>I say none of this to criticize technology. It's just reality. I will argue as I explore this topic that we must look at policy alternatives for more investment in entrepreneurial ventures and education (of both youth and displaced workers).</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2853443 href="vote?for=2853443&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2853443></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=chipsy">chipsy</a> 182 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2853443">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You reminded me of an interesting thought. The industrial revolution involved advances in information only incrementally; we went from letter-writing to (eventually) phone and television. The new mediums were very unambiguously new platforms each time.<p>But now we have a set of platforms(computers themselves, the operating systems, the networks, etc.) for all digitally encodable forms of information. We keep building new platforms on top of these systems; and the rate at which the platforms appear is increasing; 10 years ago you could not do the kinds of trivially focused apps that have become today's cliche.<p>This is a point of fundamental difference from productivity advancements in the industrial era; better machines meant more resources mined, more goods finished and delivered. And communication remained expensive throughout that period; I can recall long-distance calls still being relatively costly in my childhood(80s, early 90s).<p>In contrast, better information implies doing more with less, in the physical sense of time and effort. Taken to its literal extreme we have Twitter as an example - a broadcasting medium without the formality and overhead of TV or radio.<p>And if our advancements from here on out are mostly based on doing "less" and not "more" physically, the whole way in which our economy is measured today is going to become increasingly wrong.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2852820 href="vote?for=2852820&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2852820></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mkr-hn">mkr-hn</a> 182 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2852820">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I agree with pg - but for a different reason.<p>In the past, one of the most significant limiting factors on business growth has been the cost of human labour, and technological development has focused on working around this limitation, eliminating manual jobs and creating jobs improving the technology.<p>However, as the world population grows and certain very important finite resources, such as fossil fuels, become severely depleted (especially fossil fuel reserves that can be extracted with less energy than the fossil fuel contains), these resources become a more important limiting factor than human time.<p>I therefore predict that in the future, far more work on technological development will go towards sustainability, and less will go towards minimising human labour. Employment will rise, while the price of anything which is not sustainably produced will rise in real terms relative to the cost of labour.<p>Due to the relatively higher costs of energy intensive transportation, I expect that there will be some degree of reversal of globalisation with respect to physical goods (but not other industries). Technology will probably play a role in allowing one family or small local community to do locally what currently takes a global network of large companies.<p>I think inequality will still be a real risk long term - if we ever reach the point where the food production system can be completely automated, and everyone had at least enough technology / capital to produce what they needed to survive and be healthy, poverty would be eliminated - but if only a few people owned all the capital, and squandered most of it on luxuries while others starved, that would be a significantly worse outcome.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2851871 href="vote?for=2851871&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2851871></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=AdamTReineke">AdamTReineke</a> 183 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2851871">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I don't know the answer, but I can see it as being something like:<p>In 1100's europe, there was land that was cleared for cultivation and forest.  Most land holdings had areas of wilderness.  They cleared it as the population increased.  If the landholder could have instantly increased the population, he would have put the new people to work clearing land and planting crops (probably via leasing it to them as a landlord, or some kind of serfdom, but the mechanics of that don't matter here).  So, the number of 'jobs' available on a given landholders property might have been 5000, while the population at the time was 400.  There were more job openings than there were people.<p>Later, factories pulled population away from farms and improved farming allowed the land to feed more people than actually lived on it.  This reduced the number of farmers needed as a proportion of the population, so if the population were the same as in 1100, the 5000 jobs we had before might have dropped, perhaps to 2000 jobs, or rather, food prices would have dropped so that lots of people no longer saw farming as the best idea.  However, the population had increased greatly.  My hypothesis here is that the number of jobs that could have been productively filled was still higher than the population.<p>This process can't continue forever.  Sooner or later, the number of jobs simply crosses over the number of people looking for work.  In history, I can imagine a leader, seeing lots of able bodied, desperate, and incredibly cheap manpower seeing an opportunity to raise an army and attempting to expand their own wealth by expanding their lands.  That was a natural brake on the population line.  Today, thankfully, we don't have any mechanisms that drastically reduce the population whenever people get desperate, there isn't wide areas of undeveloped land that can absorb as many people as we have over above the jobs line, and technology continues to increase productivity at a respectable rate.<p>So that is how I explain why the jobs line can cross over the population line now, and why we may now be in a situation where we might expect to have less jobs than people who want jobs for a long time.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2852040 href="vote?for=2852040&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2852040></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=johnohara">johnohara</a> 183 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2852040">link</a></span></div><br>

Previously, as you mention, technology was uplifting silo'd productivity - but was not allowing for whole industries to be either globally distributed (information based industries) or remotely centralized (agriculture exports).<p>We now have sufficient technology in all areas to allow for both; the global distribution of knowledge working, sufficient advancements in production technology to increase output efficiencies in specific areas that centralization of output for the global economy can occur (e.g. agri output from say brazil supporting a large % of global soybean consumption - and manifacturing in China supporting a large % of global doohickey consumption)<p>We are reaching a change in the overall model of economies, where previously each nation was duplicating a large portion of the industries as their production was only enough for internal consumption.<p>If you look at the entire planet as a single resource zone, then naturally you will have uneven distribution of resources, production, knowledge, etc... thus uneven distribution of labor to support this.<p>If we could see a heat map of the globe's resources to people to markets to [name a factor]... etc. but weighted by their pull in each direction, then maybe we could better model how the global economy really looks.<p>Extra Credit: weight the flow of this map to energy dependence and you'll really see how fragile this little world is.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2851995 href="vote?for=2851995&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2851995></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=zwischenzug">zwischenzug</a> 183 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2851995">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Put aside service jobs like pizza delivery or baristas and think about manufacturing jobs or “dirty” jobs. Regarding manufacturing jobs I tend to think that technology didn’t replace those kind of jobs instead we opted to buy goods made in other countries. I can't find any current examples but the article below states that in 2007 the USA exported $4.6 billion in raw cotton and imported $52.4 billion in processed cotton goods. That’s a lot of money leaving our economy. We really need to start manufacturing again and as a nation get in to the mindset that it’s better to save and buy quality than to buy quantity.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The only transformation comparable to the present phenomenon would be the migration from rural (farming) to urban factory settings that accumulated full force about a century ago. And it was a period that was marked with great tribulations and social and culture shattering apart -- immigrant labor, worker rights, great depression, altering of government social contract (i.e., New Deal), etc.…<p>The current technology revolution is even more overarching -- yes, there are new jobs  being created, but at a fraction of the existing job base. This is not just a "claim" -- it's verifiable fact that can be easily concluded by perusing corporate employment ranks (GM used to employ nearly 1M workers -- contrast that to a modern internet company or even modern corporation which have been diminishing in employment ranks since the 90s). Review the government Labor department jobs reports -- most of the jobs created (outside of health care) are the kinds of jobs easily replaced by robotics / automation. The only damper that prevents a greater rate of transformation is the inexhaustible supply of cheap labor -- the presence of a humans willing to work at fraction of another, a seemingly bottomless pool. Might not be relevant for skilled jobs (though it is, at a lesser degree -- non immigrant visa workers supplanting American programmers for instance -- note that I am not making a case against immigration, just that immigration does have an economic effect on native workers).<p>See [Robotic Nation](<a href="http://www.marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm</a>) for a good summation of this -- yes, productivity and efficiency rise at an aggregate level, but the benefits do not accrue equally to all.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2852798 href="vote?for=2852798&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2852798></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=brudgers">brudgers</a> 182 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2852798">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>To talk about jobs lost, there were 4 million farm horses in Briton before the industrial revolution, and then over a period of 25 years in the nineteenth century, that population dropped to under a million.<p>Ford, and every other company, ran a 48 hour work week in the united states until Ford decided his factories were efficient enough that he could hire more people, pay everyone the same for 8 hours less labor, and thus sell more cars. Most every industry followed.<p>Now we've nearly a tenth of the workforce unemployed, but the story people tend to ignore is the actual hours of employment demanded per capita. The far scarier story than the United states unemployment is its underemployment, where people are willing to work but only get a few hours. Employers want to employ more people...but they can't fill more labor-hours. They can split those hours up, and because of that, a lot of the job loss is hidden.<p>Does anyone know of any other animals losing their jobs to robots?</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2852726 href="vote?for=2852726&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2852726></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=RoboTeddy">RoboTeddy</a> 182 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2852726">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The efficiency of our production is rising for centuries indeed. Once, a peon on a field could hardly produce for his own family, a modern day farmer can supply food for thousands of people.<p>Same can be seen in almost all industries.<p>For centuries this trend was offset with appearance of new kinds of production. New fields opened new markets and new places for work.<p>Lets ignore the current situation and ponder where does it lead us. It is inevitable that in the future most of day-to-day stuff we use will be produced by robots with minimal up to none human oversight.<p>There is only that much that we can consume. There is only that much of <i>different</i> kinds of produciton we can require. And we can not all be working in a creative capacity, inventing new stuff and inventing new markets. Inavitably a day will come when it will be technologically possible to supply all day-to-day the needs of world's population with stuff and services supplied mostly by robots.<p>What will happen then?<p>From several hundreds years ago, when people produced mostly for themselves, to the distant future when we all be serviced by robots and efficient production chains we see a definite trend. Somewhere along the path there should be disruptive events for this to happen, when a 'tension' produced by efficiency leads to massive losses of jobs.<p>For most of the time during the whole history the argument "it is not different then the previous time it happen" will be valid, but there will be definitely times it wont be the case. And it is possible that now is one of those times. Rise in effeciency must lead to loss of jobs <i>eventurally</i>. May be the time is now.<p>Oh, and this future is not necesserily a very dark one. After all, having most stuff produced effectively only means that most of the population will not <i>have</i> to work. Mey be it will lead to large portion of the population being a "dead weight", burning their life in leasure, and small energetic minority engaging in moving us forward, I don't know. May be it will lead to a large production 'surplus' that we will use to colonize the solar system and beyond? May be something else...<p>But I think we need to start thinking of what the society will look like when most people will not <i>have</i> to work to lead a decent life? What incentives will we need to invent to still have enough people to move forward? How to prevent degradation? I don't think artificial limits on automation and technology is the answer, but we might eventually come to this. I can see a politician introducing a SaveTheJobsBill to outlaw massively automated factories. We need to start thinking about it now, before it actually happens.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2851892 href="vote?for=2851892&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2851892></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=curt">curt</a> 183 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2851892">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Exactly. How about all the unemployed horseshoe manufacturers (blacksmiths)? Technology doesn't kill jobs, it improves efficiency so capital can be deployed elsewhere. The problem today are the hurtles government places in the way in the form of regulations and taxes that inhibit the efficient deployment of capital.<p>The divergence is that to form a single job a knowledge worker requires far less capital compared to a manufacturing job. A developer needs 10k in equipment to be productive compared to 100k's for a manufacturing job. When you actually adjust for the US regulatory and tax environment the gap increases even more, making overseas manufacturing a no-brainer.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2852348 href="vote?for=2852348&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2852348></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=troystribling">troystribling</a> 182 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2852348">link</a></span></div><br>

When the economy transitioned from farming to manufacturing a farmer could begin working in a factory with little training. Now automation is beginning to eliminate jobs at some skill levels.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; For these displaced workers to find new jobs years of training could be required.<p>I think we vastly overstate the importance of training.<p>Being a farmer, I enjoy following farm-related discussions. Farmers spend just as much time talking about the shortage of talent as tech companies do, if not more. What is interesting about farms is that the job needs to be done in a timely manner no matter what, so you have to hire the best you can, and hope they become good at the job eventually.<p>Being a software developer, I also enjoy following tech-related discussions. We read story after story of people going from absolutely no experience to profitable software company in weeks, yet we still believe that years and years of training are required to work on even the simplest of projects.<p>Tech companies come with the luxury of artificial timelines. A tech company can leave a position unfilled for months or even years without any significant impact to the bottom line. Your software codebase isn't going to shrivel up and die or your warehouse of stock isn't going to expire if it takes an additional month or two to complete a feature.<p>There is no reason why anyone with a few days of studying software development cannot join the team. We just don't need them. We can wait and hire the guy who scaled out Facebook and developed Watson while working on iOS on the side. That is the shift in employment we are seeing and no amount of training is going to resolve the underlying problem.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2855251 href="vote?for=2855251&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2855251></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Detrus">Detrus</a> 181 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2855251">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I wouldn't bet that technology should net kill jobs now. There's still a lot that must be done by humans to get to the next technological plateau. If jobs don't come back now it will be because of economic reasons. It's possible that our education and economic systems are weakened and can't keep up with the moderate tech advance we're experiencing.<p>But there should be a point in the foreseeable future at which technology will progress too quickly for mortals to keep up, despite the best education and economy. It wouldn't be the first paradigm shift of this magnitude. At one point in our past human population increased dramatically from farming, so even if people wanted to go back to hunting they could not. Then towns sprung up because farmers learned to produce a surplus. Then there wasn't enough land for everyone who wanted to farm.<p>Similarly today, we can have some people "farm" or do the essential work and produce such a large surplus of food, raw materials, technology, etc., that others will be freed from jobs, just as ancient towns were freed from farming.<p>Frankly we could make such changes with today's technology, but the economy and culture may not be ready. Instead we create contrived jobs.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2853517 href="vote?for=2853517&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2853517></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=cwb">cwb</a> 182 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2853517">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Technology does not kill jobs: instead it allows the new jobs to be created <i>elsewhere</i>.<p>50,000 BC: your "job" (finding food) so dominated your life that your entire community followed it around.<p>20,000 BC: farming began. Your "job" is in the field by your house.<p>1700 AD: agricultural revolution. Technology allows smaller number to produce food.  This allows industrial revolution. More specifically, this creates surplus food which means people can <i>move</i>. And so jobs can move. But it also means that areas that cannot produce food competitively no longer have to. Surplus food allows jobs to move to where the water wheels and resources are to commence industrialization.<p>1800 AD: The invention of the steam engine frees jobs from the need to be near flowing water: i.e. to move to where the resources are, or where the need to be. For much of the UK this was near ports as raw materials (e.g. cotton) came by ship. Bonus if the port is near a coal field. Again, areas that do not have cheap access to transport and coal, no longer have jobs.<p>1970 AD: Oil, giant ships, containerization and "free" trade allows jobs to move where wages are cheaper. Entire <i>nations</i> are uncompetitive at manufacturing.<p>2005 AD: Communications revolution. International calls are free. Service industry jobs move to where wages are cheaper. Entire <i>nations</i> are uncompetitive for service industry.<p>2008 AD: Computer Vision revolution: computers can now do picking and sorting that previously required a human.<p>201X AD: Robot Dexterity revolution: computers can now do fine motor skills, such as stitching shoes. Nike finally stops using child labor.<p>What is left for humans?<p><i>Technology has been killing (but not net killing) jobs for centuries.</i><p>Is this true? Or is it the case that as technology kills jobs, the unemployed find make work? That is, even if the unemployment level in a country has stayed the same, does it mean that the new jobs that the displaced workers perform are useful, or just a drain on society? Sure in the 19th century there were new non-make-work jobs. But today? Example: people working at Hallmark stores. Example: layer upon layer of middle and upper management. Perhaps it doesn't matter: if society can support make-work jobs, because of efficiencies elsewhere, then as long as people are employed it doesn't matter how. The problem would be if those make-work jobs could no longer be supported. This is what is happening: it is not in China's interest any more to support the vast inefficiencies of the US economic system.

The industrial revolution happened over decades, but the digital revolution happened in just a few years.  People are being displaced first by 3rd world countries, and second by machines which is faster than they may be prepared to deal with.  Additionally they may not be capable of making the jump.  Its easy to take a farmer and place him in a factory.  However it is slightly more difficult to take a factory worker, and put him in a web development shop.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2852859 href="vote?for=2852859&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2852859></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=randomdata">randomdata</a> 182 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2852859">link</a></span></div><br>

Once Doctor FootCare took the coupon code out of the new version (B) the conversion rate of the page was 6.5% higher than the old checkout page (A).

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Yeah, craziness.  If he'd be open about his agenda but consistent with the terms reality uses, I'd be fine with it.<p>I actually think carry should be taxed as regular income (except that the people who get carry are the kind of people who could structure to get around this).<p>I'd also be ok with capital gains and regular income being taxed at the same rate IFF that top rate were low (say, 25%) without deductions/credits, AMT, etc.  A flat ~25-30% tax for everyone, plus a decent personal exemption (possibly even refundable, so if it's "$20-30k in free money from the government per person per year, paid in cash or paid as a credit against taxes owed", some people can live 100% on the credit and not work.<p>Allowing capital gains to offset capital losses, with carryover, probably is enough privilege to capital gains vs. regular income.  It may create some disinvestment at the margin, but there's plenty of capital out there.  For a startup founder making $100mm at exit, there isn't really an argument that he'd take the $200k/yr job instead of the $100k/yr job with the shot at the big exit due to being taxed 25% vs. 15% at exit; the uncertainty remains in the "will my company sell (and will it be for big money)", not the tax rate at that time.<p>That said, I'm totally happy taking every capital gain benefit available to me; waiting 5 years for a $10mm tax-free capital gain (Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, good for investments including founder shares purchased until 12-31-2011) is pretty damn nice.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2846033 href="vote?for=2846033&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%35%47%64%4d%49%31%7a%6d%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2846033></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kds">kds</a> 184 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2846033">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>But in a way this rings true - after an exit event if the former CEO/founder gets mostly stocks/paper his financial well-being is deeply connected with the general well-being of Wall Street, as a system.<p>The more bullish is the market - the better for him, and for the whole ecosystem of financial institutions that serve him. In this sense he is a part of the financial industry and shares the general systemic risk (though, of course, this varies in individual cases and portfolios)<p>His position is no different than hers - the enriched with stocks ex-wife of an investment banker after the divorce (also a kind of exit strategy, btw).</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr style="height:10px"></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=14></td><td class="title"><a href="/x?fnid=fZVby5y2jG" rel="nofollow">More</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=10 width=0><table width="100%" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=1><tr><td bgcolor=#ff6600></td></tr></table><br>
