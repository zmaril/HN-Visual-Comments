<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I would not treat this story as a sign of how to convince VCs.  It is almost never the case that VCs say yes because of one magically convincing point you make.<p>Fred is not a purely functional VC (by which I mean not that he's dysfunctional, but that he's stateful).  This slide was accompanied by lots of other evidence, including multiple prior meetings.  The slide was just the final increment that pushed him over into yes.  It is very unlikely that if a random person had walked up to him and shown him the same slide, Fred would have been convinced.<p>What convinces VCs is, in order, (a) growth, (b) the founders' personal characteristics, (c) what you say to them. If you seem like an effective person and you have graphs that go up steeply, your pitch could be a bunch of platitudes and they'd still be eager to invest.  (As would we, to be honest.)  Whereas if you seem like an ineffective person and have no traction, you could have the best story in the world, and they will all say no.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I don't quite 'get it':  So, "Could you expand on your answer a little, please".<p>You seem to be saying that the key is "traction", significant and growing rapidly.<p>Then it sounds like someone who was just featured on the TV show 'Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives" and has significant 'traction' growing rapidly would get a VC investment?<p>Or so could someone who opened a pizza shop in a hot, new shopping mall.<p>So, it sounds like nothing about the core technology, Buffett 'moat', potential business size, or business planning is relevant?<p>Then, suppose the business is a new Web site.  Suppose the founder gets from his ISP a static IP address and 15 Mbps upload bandwidth.  Suppose his largest Web page can be sent for less than 200,000 bits.  Suppose he half fills his bandwidth 24 x 7 for<p><pre><code>     ( 15 * 10**6 ) / ( 2 * 200,000 ) = 37.5

pages sent per second.  Suppose he sends three ads per page and gets $1 per thousand ads displayed (CPM). Then his revenue would be greater than<p><pre><code>     1 * 3 * 37.5 * 3600 * 24 * 30 / 1000 = 291,600

dollars a month.  Now just why would he accept equity funding?<p>Net, it sounds like, for an entrepreneur, when equity funding might help, his project is 'too early', and, by the time the funding is available, the VCs are too late.<p>So, it sounds like VC funding is for where (A) the business has suddenly encountered some problem and needs cash fast or (B) the founder wants to take some cash off the table and not for usual business formation.<p>Then back to the restaurant:  All across the US, restaurants and Main Street businesses get built without VC funding, and commonly those businesses need much more in capital equipment, ovens, site renovation, trucks, etc. than a Web site filling 15 Mbps upload bandwidth.  So, if those businesses don't need VC funding, why do new Web sites?</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3115909 href="vote?for=3115909&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3115909></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 112 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3115909">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Comment threads where 'pg talks about how he or others decide to make equity investments seem to draw out responses like this one, which all seem to amount to "nuh-uh, it's super hard to get funding".<p>Well, respectfully, no shit. None of these firms are charities. Every new founding team in the world --- I think literally <i>every one of them</i> --- discovers the seeming chicken/egg problem of traction and money. Think about it; if that problem didn't exist, everyone on HN would have a funded startup.<p>VC firms will make speculate on a new team if that team has impossible-to-ignore traction. They'll speculate on an unproven business model if the team has an impossible-to-ignore track record. Where are the instances where successful VC has ever speculated on both at the same time?<p>You lay out a scenario here illustrating that by the time you have enough traction to (you think) satisfy Wilson or Graham, you won't need them anymore. Bully for you! The same thing happened to us, and hundreds of other startups; it's called bootstrapping. If you can bootstrap, you should; you'll keep more control and ownership.<p>But I should point out that lots and lots of companies that bootstrap themselves to a comfortably thrumming business end up taking VC in the long term, for the same reason a conservative poker player is eventually going to bet heavily on pocket aces. Eventually you come across an opportunity that begs you to scale up quickly and buy market share. Part of the point of bootstrapping is to allow you to be choosy about the hands you play.<p>In the meantime, stop complaining about investors not giving you the time of day. It's silly. There are things to complain about regarding investors, but not handing free money out to unproven businesses isn't one of them. Investment firms are themselves businesses (they aren't investing their own money!) and their responsibility isn't to you or even the startup system; it's to their LPs.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3116264 href="vote?for=3116264&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3116264></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=NY_Entrepreneur">NY_Entrepreneur</a> 111 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3116264">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#737373>"nuh-uh, it's super hard to get funding".<p>I never suggested any such thing.  But I WAS being critical:  PG's description amounted to saying that VCs want to get on the plane only after it has already left the runway.  Although I didn't say it, I suspect that, then, what PG is saying is not all that close to how VC funding works.  I wasn't being critical about it being "super hard" to get funding but just about the apparent contradiction in what PG wrote.<p>The VCs can do what they want.  As Mark Suster has illustrated with some graphs and data, over the past 10 years the VCs have been doing poorly, and about half the partners are 'unemployed' as VCs.<p>So, I can't 'look up' to the VCs as business experts.  They have MBAs; pseudo-great, I've been an MBA prof.  Some VCs have had some startup experience, maybe in 'biz dev'.  Pseudo-great;  I helped start one of the most successful VC funded companies in history.  And as IT experts, I have to look down on nearly all of VCs (although YC is an exception) so far I'd need a Hubble telescope to tell them apart.  I've taught computing in two research universities, published peer-reviewed original research in computer science, mathematical statistics, applied mathematics, and artificial intelligence, and helped ship two commercial products from Yorktown Heights.<p>Any way it goes, I have to build a successful business.  So does every entrepreneur on Main Street who opens a pizza shop, auto body shop, grass mowing service, etc.<p>So, as you wrote, by the time I've built a successful business, say not an "unproven" business, I would be able to sell a fraction to a VC.  Okay.  Just why I'd want to do that escapes me.<p>Or, the day before I take a VC check I have a 'proven' business, say, half filling 15 Mbps upload bandwidth with revenue close to $300 K a month and own 100% of it.  The day after I take a VC seed check, I have $100 K -- $500 K more cash in the bank, that is, revenue from 1-2 months, where it took me much longer than 2 months to get the seed check, own none of my company, have to get my fraction of 'my' company back on a four year 'vesting' schedule, and can be fired by the Board at any time.  Bummer.<p>My point is not that it's tough to get VC funding.  Indeed, I MUST build a successful business, VC funding or bootstrapped.  It's plenty clear, from what PG wrote and more, that once I've built a successful business, say, $300 K a month in revenue growing quickly, then I could get a VC check.  And PG is saying that much before then, I can't get a VC check.  Okay.  Thems are the rules.  Good to know the rules.<p>So, what was my point?  Just that the rules as PG wrote them don't make much sense.  I doubt that what he wrote is very close to the truth.<p>As an entrepreneur, I have to evaluate the potential of my business early on.  Nowhere did PG mention that a VC will review that evaluation.  Here he is mostly correct:  One could count with shoes on all the VCs in the country who could evaluate or even direct the evaluation of the crucial, core 'secret sauce' in an IT business plan.<p>People have mentioned a similar point before:  If VCs want to wait until there is significant traction growing quickly, now they risk waiting too long.  That is, it used to be that, to get the traction, the company needed funding to write the software.  Surprise:  At least from Microsoft, once one understands the relevant parts of .NET, essentially all the code for a Web site, indeed, for much of commercial software, is already written, and all that's needed it a little, simple glue to join the .NET code.<p>Next, surprise:  If usage grows, then can call up, say, Tiger Direct, get some parts, and plug together one heck of a 64 bit server for less than $1000.  We're talking what, 4 AMD cores at 3.0 GHz for $100?  A motherboard for $100?  Main memory at $10 per GB?  2 TB hard drives for $100 each?  A high end Antec power supply for $100?  A case for $50?  Some fans for $2 or so each?  What'd I leave out?<p>Next, surprise:  If usage is significant, just $1 CPM will throw off enough cash to buy servers enough to double capacity in less than two weeks.  So, that's exponential growth.  Bandwidth used to be really expensive.  Surprise:  Now where I live $15 Mbps upload with a static IP address costs $65 a month, and CAN use it for a Web site.<p>Fred Wilson has written on his blog that these changes are good for VCs.  Maybe.  And I continue to see the major successes taking VC funding and don't have a good list of successful bootstrapped companies.<p>Still, from what PG wrote, basically I've got to have, say, $300 K a month in revenue, growing quickly, to qualify for a Series A.  But, in my case, that's just me and my team, two of whom have four legs, long tails, and long whiskers, and myself and I and a server at my left knee in my living room.  For the server, I have one in a box in the next room.  I also have an offer of a loan of one with 32 cores and 2 TB of main memory -- that used to be a lot of disk; now it's main memory!  BELEIVE me, a 32 core server could send well over 35 pages a second from my Web site software!  For the Microsoft software, their BizSpark program will let me, or essentially any IT startup, have the copies of Windows Server and SQL Server for free for a while.<p>Again, I'm not complaining that getting a VC check is too hard.  Indeed, again, I need to build a successful business, say, $300 K a month growing quickly by myself.  And, apparently PG would agree that with such a business I could get a VC check.  Okay.  But why then would I want to take a VC check?<p>Net, if I can ramp up to $300 K a month in revenue, I won't need a VC check.  If I can't, I can't get a VC check.  So, either way, there's no VC check.  So, my point is, with PGs description, of what use are the VCs?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"You seem angry."<p>The reply by tptacek discarded the point I was trying to make and claimed that I was just complaining because, according to an uninformed claim of tptacek, I was having trouble raising equity funding.  The goal of tptacek was to try to gain upper status via an insult.  That was a personal attack for no good reason, and I was angry at tptacek.  Otherwise, I'm not angry at VCs.<p>For PG's post, it seemed to be deliberately a bit far away from what VCs do.  It's frustrating to see such from the other side of the table.<p>"Traction isn't necessarily the same as revenue."  Well, one form of 'traction' is a lot of users, and in some cases can have that long before any revenue.  Examples include the early months of YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.  So, they had a lot of 'unique eyeballs' per month, and the assumption was that there should be a way, somehow, to 'monitize' that.  Maybe.  Usually.<p>In my case, a lot of eyeballs mean a lot of Web pages served and, for my Web pages, a lot of ads displayed.  Then a lot of eyeballs mean a lot of revenue and, in my case, nearly all that revenue pre-tax earnings.  Or, yes, I thought of 'monitization' up front.  My most important Web pages have been carefully designed to have a banner ad of 720 x 90 pixels across the top and some number of ads 300 x 250 pixels down the right side.  So in my case, 'traction' and 'revenue' go together.<p>"PG's view of the world isn't a universal rule."  Yes, that is a weak version of my main point.<p>Maybe some LPs have asked their GPs to fund only 'traction', but likely some VCs are still able to fund something off the back of a napkin if they really want to.  Even if they could, to me that's a bit moot:  VC funding or not, likely not, like anyone on Main Street, I still need to build a successful business.  At one time, a shot of VC funding could have helped my project a little.  But now I'm so close to going live that what VCs do is getting to be a bit irrelevant.  I'm still in touch with some VCs in case my personal funding runs out, but my guess is that it won't.  Lots of pizza shops get to earnings without VC funding, and my project should be able to, also.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3116528 href="vote?for=3116528&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3116528></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 111 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3116528">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You keep assuming that my concern here is my business.  It's NOT.  My concern was just being clear on just what the heck VCs do.<p>VCs are welcome to do what they want.  While I have very little respect for all but a tiny fraction of VCs, I am not angry at any of them although I believe that here PG was not accurate.<p>VCs and my business are close to mutually irrelevant.<p>From all I can tell, my business is doing well, but, yes, I will be happier when I am getting $300 K+ a month in revenue.<p>"Crossfire", what VCs do in general or nearly always, etc. are getting to be nearly irrelevant for everyone:  Just a short look at the finances of a VC and see that VCs need 'home runs'.  All the rest is low grade work or just a waste of time, effort, and money.  But there are only a few 'home runs' each decade in all IT VC in the US.  So, 99 44/100% of what VCs 'do' is irrelevant, for all concerned.  In particular, what is 'usual' is irrelevant.  And for the VCs, 'patterns' are irrelevant.<p>The major failing of VCs is that they do not have effective criteria to select the 100 - (99 44/100) of interest, or even the candidates.  So, about all they can do is follow the herd of the 'usual', draw their 2%, and hope a home run comes out of the blue.  That's the key reason on average they are not making much if any money.<p>That lack of effective criteria is in wildly strong contrast with essentially everything in serious applications of science, in engineering, and in technology outside of VCs.<p>My criteria that get me to invest my effort are nothing like those of the VCs, usual or otherwise.  On this point, I'm standing on solid ground, and the VCs are standing in a swamp.<p>It looks like Darwin will have the last word.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=320></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3117584 href="vote?for=3117584&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3117584></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=joshu">joshu</a> 111 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3117584">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"They look at patterns. This is what VC does."<p>Yup, again, they don't have effective criteria.<p>"You have a content business."  Wrong.  You are misinformed.<p>"Also, if you conduct yourself in person like you do here that is probably another issue."<p>What I do here is fine.  What PG wrote is a bit far from what VCs do, and I called BS.<p>Generally people want to suck up to the VCs and get all excited when they 'receive a round of funding'.  No, what they did was just sell a huge chunk of their business and put themselves under the control of a VC Board under some really bad terms.  I won't suck up to VCs.<p>Entrepreneurs, including in IT, and on HN, need simply to observe that the US, border to border, is just awash in entrepreneurs who start successful businesses on Main Street with no contact with VCs.  The people I've seen in yacht clubs were mostly successful on Main Street, and there wasn't a penny of VC equity in sight.<p>My mention of a pizza shop is dead on the center of the target:  Now a Web site serving a few dozen Web pages a second takes much less in capital equipment to get started than a pizza shop.  And the Web site has some advantages, e.g., once the site is up, mostly just lean back and let the servers do the work, 24 x 7, and that beats the heck out of all the food handling, kitchen cleaning, floor washing, worker supervising, customer interactions, etc. at a pizza shop.<p>I and likely nearly all of us have neighbors in big truck, little truck businesses, fast food, gas stations, rental property, various trades, etc.  They make it, buy houses and new cars, get their kids through college, etc. without a big failure rate and without VC.  A Web site can be a better business, still.<p>Since on average, as reported by Mark Suster, VCs are not making much if any money, I have more respect as businessmen for a guy running a pizza shop, especially a guy running several, than I do for VCs.<p>For technical expertise, maybe in all the US a dozen IT VCs have some significant technical qualifications, and otherwise they would be at best just dead weight in an IT startup.  So I can't respect VCs technically either.  VCs commonly have a LOT of trouble handling their e-mail; NOT good.  VCs commonly want others, lawyers, CEOs, bankers, etc., to 'filter' entrepreneurs for them; NOT good.  VCs commonly assert that they have wide 'networks' -- mostly not among well qualified technical people!  Nearly none of the VCs are anything like the people I respected in math and physics in school or like the people I respected, say, at Yorktown Heights.<p>VCs need entrepreneurs more than entrepreneurs need VCs.  So, I'm not here to suck up to VCs.  For what PG wrote, I call BS.  So be it.  There's nothing wrong with that.  HN is for 'hackers' who should not be sucking up to VCs.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=400></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3117923 href="vote?for=3117923&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3117923></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 111 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3117923">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>VCs want a specific kind of entrepreneur. You might need to face up to the fact that, generalizations aside, they don't need <i>you</i> or <i>me</i>, despite the fact that we are entrepreneurs. Similarly, as admirable as it is to get a local small business off the ground, all the rationalization in the world isn't going to get Fred Wilson to fund your favorite pizza shop. Try convincing the owner to make grilled cheese, instead.<p>You might also pay careful attention to what Joshua Schacter is telling you about how VCs look at content businesses, because all the HN comments in the world aren't going to change the fact that it's hard to get funded with a business model that has become unpopular among VCs.<p>But on the other hand, like I've said ad nauseum: if you can go it alone without VC, I agree that you should. We did; we've been growing at a steady clip since 2005, and not chasing VC is (by unanimous consent among the founders) one of the better decisions we made.<p>I'll say it yet again: there are a lot of things to complain about with the VC model. I just don't buy that what they choose to fund is one of those things. If VC won't put money into something that is obviously a strong bet, that should be an exploitable market inefficiency; a place to build up market power and differentiation without competing with 10 me-too valley shoot-the-moon built-to-flip startups.<p>Good luck with your thing!</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3115859 href="vote?for=3115859&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3115859></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=simonw">simonw</a> 112 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3115859">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"an organization formed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model"<p>I've read that some dozens of times from Blank.<p>Sounds like a guy opening a pizza shop knows better what he's doing than the IT startups Blank is talking about!<p>Not all IT startups have to be less well directed than a pizza shop!  Bluntly, for a well planned startup, I conclude that Blank is nearly always wrong.<p>I helped start a company, now world famous.  In my offer letter I was promised stock.  Later the COB said that the amount would be $500,000.  I never got the stock.  That stock would be worth about $500 million now.  Yup, I missed out.  But I did get some startup experience.  Got'a tell you, what Blank said didn't describe what we were doing at all.  We always knew JUST what our business model was, and we were correct from the beginning to the present.  It wasn't tough to know.  Sometimes Blank is seriously wrong.<p>"You've bootstrapped your company."  From what PG wrote, sounds like I don't have much choice:  No matter what "more" it takes, I have to have it done before a VC will write a check.  But, then, as you said, I will already have "bootstrapped" my company.<p>"I imagine you'll find that you need a lot more than a static IP address and 15 Mbps upload bandwidth to get there though."  Sure.  The point about the static IP address and the 15 Mbps upload bandwidth was just to illustrate that by the time I've got the "more" done and am ready to go live, we're not talking bucks big enough to eat up an average Series A.  Instead we're talking much less cash that it would take to keep a new pizza shop going for the first week.<p>My point isn't how much an entrepreneur needs to do.  My point is that by the time the entrepreneur has gone live, gotten significant traction, and has the traction going, and, thus, qualified for VC funding, if he can half fill 15 Mbps upload bandwidth, then he won't want to take VC money.<p>Put more simply, PG is saying that the VCs want to get on the plane after it has already left the ground.  Okay by me.  I'm just trying to understand the rules of the game.<p>I didn't mention it, but my guess is that the severe rules PG is describing have been 'suggested' by the LPs.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3115916 href="vote?for=3115916&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3115916></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rdouble">rdouble</a> 112 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3115916">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I am not sure if VC firms doing seed investing have done it in such large numbers and if not (which I think is the case), are they setup to manage 100 startups a year versus 15.<p>Also I am wondering if this approach will have to be the new approach or the one that Khosla, Benchmark, Sequoia (I understand they are indirectly in YC companies) and similar ones have had for long, of identifying big trends, finding the right company and going big behind it, is still better. I have seen the latter fail as well as succeed. I think we have very little data on the former but there is bound to be a limited set of companies that a VC partnership can optimally support / manage and this new approach may put a strain on it.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>As a SV outsider who recently spent a month there, I totally agree. The only way to get meetings is through your network. Start with people you meet at events and then add to it (co working spaces like www.rocket-space.com are great for this). Eventually you'll be speaking to company founders and they can refer you. Remember that the quality of the referral is also important, so if you have only met someone for 5 mins and then ask them to refer you, their referral email will be rather weak. Spend the time building the relationship and getting them excited about your product. Then when the time comes you will get a solid referral and a near certain meeting.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3113770 href="vote?for=3113770&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3113770></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dan_manges">dan_manges</a> 112 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3113770">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>If a handful of YC companies are truly asking for a $9M or 14M pre...  as rumors are flying around in Silicon Valley state...  Then, I could see why VC's might say that the market is overpriced and frothy.  Especially, since 6 months earlier, those same startups were priced by YC at a $300k pre.<p>No doubt YC has a phenomenal brand, and does a great job, and has had a couple of impressive rounds raised recently by AirBnb and DropBox.<p>But, there's a huge segment of the startup ecosystem that doesn't really show up on HN.<p>MassChallenge is graduating 125 startups next month.  Their last batch, last summer has raised $100M in total.<p>Angel List has helped over 700 startups get funded in the past 18 months.<p>Startup Chile just seed funded 125, and opened applications open for another 100 startups today.<p>Then, there's 500 Startups, IO Ventures, RockHealth, AngelPad, StartX, BlockBox, TechStars, etc...  And, a number of those startups have raised really impressive rounds, but they don't tend to get the local blog coverage or coverage here on HN.<p>Who knows...

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm not alarmed because there seems to be two very distinct crowds of people who hang out on hacker news.  "Startup people", like yourself, who are across the political spectrum, with probably a disproportionate number of libertarians (as compared to the broader population) and the /r/politics crowd which are very anti-capitalist, anti-innovation, pro-taxes, etc.<p>Some threads attract one crowd and the comments go one way, other threads attract the other crowd and the comments go the other way.<p>I really wish Hacker News was about startups, and if there was any debate, we were all capitalists debating it.  I'm tired of the seemingly endless stream of leftist propaganda that gets promoted to the front page (e.g.: anything by Krugman, for example.)  I'd hate this just as much if it were all rightest propaganda.  IF it was balanced, I wouldn't like it, but it wouldn't be irritating.<p>When almost all the discussions are of one mindset, and posting something outside that mindset gets you down voted to oblivion, I feel like intellectual discussion is much more difficult.  This isn't always the case here, obviously, but sometimes it is.<p>I don't really care for Amazon, but at least when Amazon is on the front page its because they did something relevant to the site.  I can just ignore those threads. Amazon' announcing that they've got a new finger service in AWS doesn't add anything for me, but it doesn't detract like the political topics do.<p>Cloudant, a company that takes CouchDB and turns it into a dynamo style ring, has produced something significant in their platform.   We should be talking about this.<p>Cloudant provides a very useful tool that should be very highly relevant to people who are doing startups.<p>The thing is, I suspect a major population of HN commenters aren't really doing startups or planning to.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105036 href="vote?for=3105036&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105036></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 115 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105036">link</a></span></div><br>

Whether or not you agree with the sentiments expressed in the parent comment, the fact is that it doesn't meet those standards. Even if the logic wasn't childish ("fuck X by association", really?), the comment does little to substantiate its opinions, or to educate those who aren't aware of the issue. In other words, it's a populist comment expressly made to pander to those who are already in agreement.<p>Upvoting said comment means either (a) you haven't even considered the importance of having a quality discussion, (b) you've considered it but in this case you don't care, or (c) you actually think it's a high quality comment. The fact that the comment is sitting pretty at the top of the page means that people have, en masse, fallen into one of these categories.

Furthermore, your defense is pretty poor: "leaving the country" would be inconvenient. And you don't think it would be inconvenient for companies to refuse to do business with others who have at some point committed an ethics violation?<p>I'm sorry but your entire position is full of double standards that you can't justify.

For what it's worth I am apolitical, and have little interest in provoking controversy, but that doesn't mean I wish to see the promotion of a company which pushes injustice across the world.<p>Previously, I had looked up to you as a bit of a hero, now my opinion of you has dived quite low. I would not have minded if you disagreed with the merits of what Monsanto and Monsanto's customers choose to do. However, referring to people as dumb, for upvoting what is essentially a very well held and defensible position is a very weak thing to do. There are lots of arguments to be made against Monsanto, not the least of which is its Superfund environmental disaster sites.<p>The point is, I am informed, I know exactly what I am against, and have every reason to be outraged at the injustice perpetrated by Monsanto. This is furthered by needing to make the same arguments against Monsanto at my own company. If we've gotten to the point where we can't be outraged against injustice, then we may as well be heartless automatons.<p>To summarily dismiss them in this way and at the same time attack the intelligence of your readers is, well, reprehensible. Call me dumb if you will, I won't make arguments to the level of my own intelligence, but know that you have invalidated every reason to see you as a role model.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105683 href="vote?for=3105683&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105683></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nirvana">nirvana</a> 114 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105683">link</a></span></div><br>

I think it is dumb to assume that just because a lot of people say the same thing about something, that means they are right, especially when they cannot go into details, and what they are saying is just broad political assertions.<p>"The point is, I am informed, I know exactly what I am against, and have every reason to be outraged at the injustice perpetrated by Monsanto."<p>If you're informed, why aren't you specific?  Even when describing what you're outraged, the best you can say is "injustice".  Such a weak word, and what does it really mean anyway?  They did something you don't like?<p>Wendy's screwed up my order the other day, giving me someone else's food, and they didn't give me a coupon to compensate.  Oh, the injustice!  Sure, that's silly, but at least I described specifically what they did wrong!<p>You're "outraged" at something you can't even describe.  Yet you're "apolitical".  Really?<p>Personally, I'm so tired of people going around repeating things they heard from other people, without doing any investigation or applying a legitimate moral compass to the issue.<p>This leads to "heartless automatons"... people who are easily controlled by media outlets.  "Hate walmart!"  (but don't hate Target, they're just the same, only they're unionized, and therefore they're not evil.)  "Blame Wall Street!" (But ignore the government that, via regulation, forced banks to make loans to people who couldn't repaying them, claiming that to do otherwise was "racist".) etc. etc. etc.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3106488 href="vote?for=3106488&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3106488></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nowarninglabel">nowarninglabel</a> 114 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3106488">link</a></span></div><br>

"Monsanto entered India in 2002 with some very compelling advertising. They claimed their engineered seeds would produce yields up to five times that of conventional cotton – 20 quintals per acre (equivalent to approximately 4.5 bales) compared to the 4 quintals (less than 1 bale) farmers were struggling to pull from their fields at the time. At the time, Monsanto admitted that their seeds costed more but insisted that investment would pay dividends.<p>Unfortunately the average yield of Monsanto’s GE cotton turned out to be nowhere near the advertised 20 quintals per acre. In reality the average output of the crop turned out to be 1.2 quintals per acre. Nowhere in India did it exceed 4 quintals per acre at the end of the harvest. To add insult to injury, farmers soon found out that the fibers produced by the Monsanto GE cotton plants were of lower quality. Instead of getting the usual $86 per quintal, they were only able to sell their crops for around $36 per quintal.
On average since 2002, of the farmers in India, many of whom fell into the Monsanto trap, one is committing suicide every 30 minutes. Many end their lives by drinking RoundUp."<p>The list goes on, if you've read this far and want more, I'll be glad to dig up some more of the material.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105245 href="vote?for=3105245&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105245></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=oldstrangers">oldstrangers</a> 114 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105245">link</a></span></div><br>

I figured my previous comment was pretty clear.<p>Asserting that Cloudant is only selling Monsanto a simple data analysis is disingenuous, as clearly proven by Cloudant's own press release where they state how significant their partnership with Monsanto is. Partnership is a key word here.<p>Selling someone a service like Google Analytics (random example) is a lot different than partnering with a company for multiple weeks and shaping the entire core functionality of a company around your collaborative efforts. Even more so is saying that this partnership will help shape the way the company fundamentally does business.<p>Like I said, its disingenuous to downplay Cloudant's role, considering how highly they emphasized said role.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105308 href="vote?for=3105308&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105308></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=janj">janj</a> 114 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105308">link</a></span></div><br>

I was sure I wasn't going to get in, but I did, and when I got there I understood that the application wasn't elitist, it was because the venue was pretty fixed in size... and the quality of the event was much different due to this (relatively light) filter you'd applied.<p>I think hacker news would be much different if you applied a similar filter.<p>If everyone here were someone sincerely interested in doing a startup, who believed that it was moral to make money by improving people's lives, and believed that technological innovation was a good way to do it, then I think the site would be much different.<p>The early quality has turned HN into a popular source for a certain segment of news.  But that has diluted it as an effective community.<p>Occasionally there's been talk of doing another site along these lines, but the right kind of filter wasn't obvious.<p>I think that it is clear what the right kind of filter is-- an application form like the Startup School one.<p>I don't know what your intentions are for HN going forward, if you have any interest in making significant changes or not.   After Nirvana (my open source web platform project) is released, and my startups MVP is done, I intend to write software for a community of startup founders and see if we can make a go of it.<p>But you have a much bigger following.  I think if you liked this idea, picking a hundred or so of the commenters you liked the best from the site would enable rapid evaluation of such applications (especially if the applications were relatively short).   However, it might be too easy to game such a system.<p>But that's where my thoughts are.  I always like to try and propose a solution when I see a problem, even if I am not sure my solution will work.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105598 href="vote?for=3105598&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105598></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=deea">deea</a> 114 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105598">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Can't speak for PG, but I'd say you lost him by #2. I never understood this kind of lump-everything-together thinking. It's overly idealistic, totally illogical, and almost always hypocritical.<p>Yes, boycotting a business is a common way to demonstrate your disapproval with some of their practices. However, it doesn't follow that doing business with a company implies condoning of all of their actions. I'm sorry, but there's no logic that supports such a conclusion.<p>And even if the logic existed, anyone who invoked it would be a glaring hypocrite. I assume you use a bank? Pay taxes to your government? Buy food, and shelter, and other products? Well you're undoubtedly a patron to at least a few entities who've committed atrocities. By your own logic, you condone each and every one of these attrocities.

People on HN are thinkers.  Sure there are clusters of opinion, but these aren't disjoint sets across the spectrum.  We have a variety of nuanced opinion because we all think a lot.<p>Case in point: me.  I guess you could say I lean a bit liberal, but fiscally I'm conservative because I think on balance the government doesn't do a good job spending money.  I believe in capitalism, but I also believe that regulation is necessary (despite its blunt nature) to protect the public good.<p>The Monsanto issue an important one.  They are profiting at the expense of the quality of the world food supply, and they use a lot of strong-arm methods to maintain their profits.  Reasonable people can disagree about various corporations' practices, but to pigeon-hole people who complain about Monsanto rather than going and educating yourself about what they do does yourself and the whole world a disservice.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"The reason this comment thread is a worrying sign for HN is that you didn't use to have to think like a PR person here."<p>A couple of things.<p>Why are we talking about the "PR issue"? I offered Cloudant an alternative reality where, if they insisted on being evil, that their evil doings be kept in the closet. It makes wise business sense if you're going to accept money from anyone under the sun. That has nothing to do with thinking like a PR person, nor does it have anything to do with having this article spun or censored. You seem to think this deal is ok, so I tried to provide a solution that suited your own interests.<p>However, it is perhaps ironic that by spinning your own comments to focus on these PR irrelevancies, you have successfully avoided providing any significant contribution. Worse yet, was the "PR spin" of yours by comparing Cloudant's strategic and "fundamentally business shaping" partnership with Monsanto to someone selling a car or a computer... I guess though that's not PR talk, that's politician talk. Expert level diversion.<p>Monsanto is a disgusting, despicable, horrible company of the worst variety. Should we give Cloudant a pass for dealing with these people because you have a vested interest? I will happily leave HN forever if you think that is the case.<p>Google started their company with the motto "Do No Evil." Ethics have a substantial place in business practice, so I don't see why they shouldn't have a place on HN.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105340 href="vote?for=3105340&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105340></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ForrestN">ForrestN</a> 114 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105340">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think sometimes tone is important. Both jubilantly celebrating a massive association with an incredibly awful company, and condescending to users by calling them stupid, don't really seem to serve anyone.<p>The problem isn't that they aren't spinning right, the problem is that it's pretty obvious that Cloudant doesn't care about working with evil companies, and that you're feeling somewhat disdainful of a lot of your users.<p>Both are unbecoming, and I think that's all people are trying to reflect (even if they are somewhat confused in how they frame their statements). People want to believe that you all aren't just smart, that you're good guys, so to speak, ie. that all the talk about "being good" isn't opportunistic, or that you aren't mean and reactive. I don't think either of those things matter particularly, and maybe they aren't germane to the kinds of conversations you'd hoped to be having, but I understand the impulse.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105204 href="vote?for=3105204&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105204></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jasonlotito">jasonlotito</a> 115 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105204">link</a></span></div><br>

When it comes to soil fertility and contamination we should be looking ahead 100 years.<p>1. lowered levels of food production have their own averse effects and risks, notably, famine and starvation. herbicides, persticides and monocultures of high yield strains are widely believed to be responsible for saving a billion lives. if you eliminated those things from the planet right now, hundreds of millions of people would starve next year.<p>2. the things you're talking about aren't monsanto's fault. people are doing business with monsanto willingly. you don't have to buy gmo seeds (or any seeds) from them if you don't want to.<p>&#62; Is it possible for a group to select and breed their seeds over years, and eventually having a breed that is similar to a patented Monsanto seed?<p>sure. if you have a breed similar to a monsanto seed, they'd win a lawsuit against you only if your breed had the same gene that they patented. you may think that that's not fair, but that's how things work. if i win a patent for a space engine for interstellar space travel, and you independently invent the same engine, i'd also win a lawsuit against you. also note that no one has actually bred a RoundUp resistant strain of plants independently of monsanto.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105113 href="vote?for=3105113&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105113></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=cickpass_broken">cickpass_broken</a> 115 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105113">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>1. If we continue our use of herbicides/pesticides to the point of wide-spread colony collapse, spread of plant disease (perhaps canola, soy, or corn), significant reduction of nitrate fixation, increased human cancers we may also see hundreds of millions of people die or be without food.<p>Obviously, no one is suggesting we stop producing enough food for people to eat. But you need to look past the next 5, 10, 25 years. Those issues listed above are all real. And can all be linked to herbicides/pesticides and monocultures. We need to work on a new solution, a new system. The current situation is not a long-term answer.<p>2. This is more a theoretical morality issue. How much control/ownership should any one entity be allowed to have on life. What if they aren't just patenting seeds for RoundUp resistance? More so, say I live in a certain climate where I want a certain field tomato to grow. And under those circumstances I end up with a seed similar to a patented Monsanto seed. I lose in court. Other varieties of tomatoes don't grow will in my area. What do I do? I no longer have the freedom or right to grow successful tomatoes. This is not reality, but a possibility. One, that I do not believe in the slightest is worth risking. This could also lead to outrageous seed pricing.<p>Oh while I'm at it. Let's add climate change, land degradation (<a href="http://news.mongabay.com/2006/1214-unu.html" rel="nofollow">http://news.mongabay.com/2006/1214-unu.html</a>). Basically, yes we need to feed billions, but we also need to do that 25-50 years from now. The practices used for high-yield crops are limiting our ability to produce food in the future.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3108983 href="vote?for=3108983&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3108983></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=viggity">viggity</a> 114 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3108983">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>1. There is plenty of genetic diversity (aka hetrozygosity). The most credible evidence suggests that Colony Collapse Syndrome was caused by a disease, not GMO seed. Also, all of the seed companies take tremendous care to ensure that their patented biotech traits (BT) keep working in future, which is why they all have refuge requirements (meaning a farmer must plant at least X percent of their crop that isn't BT, which makes sure that various pests continue to breed with genes that will make their offspring susceptible to herbicide/pesticide treatment).<p>2. Corn has tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of genes and has roughly 22 million nucleotide base pairs. Having two breeders from two different companies come up with roughly the same plant interdependently is in the astronomical range.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3104368 href="vote?for=3104368&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3104368></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=biznickman">biznickman</a> 115 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3104368">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Here is a potential reason why some are upset. Its obvious that large corporations like Chevy, Clorox, Apple sell to Monstanto [and other corporations some could consider "bad" or whatever you want to label it]. But when startups do it [especially YC startups who I generally believe have smarter people involved relative to large corporations] it is felt because people generally hold them to higher standards [not just in situations like this, it applies for operational, financial and strategic measures as well]. I worked at a YC startup for a while, and saw some pretty generous things done by YC founders for society.<p>Another way to look at it (if it helps you understand the other perspective): You frequently see YC funded companies help each other out. Why do they do it? Is it just to accumulate more wealth/raise a valuation? Or is it because they've developed meaningful relationships and care for each other? I use this example to show how empathy and relationships can impact business decisions in a general sense, and that this same logic could be used to apply to a YC company NOT being proud of serving a large corporation known to use tactics that harm farmers in underdeveloped nations.<p>The fact that you use the term 'hold to a standard' at least implies that some could perceive the action as 'slimy'.<p>Finally, as someone wise once said, "be the change you want to see in the world" -- of course we hold YC companies to a higher standard :), many are made up of brilliant and compassionate individuals whose products make the world a better place. /cheese</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3106768 href="vote?for=3106768&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3106768></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=csallen">csallen</a> 114 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3106768">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I love the idea that ethics should be a hobby one does after their day job. We get angry about things like that because if a small group of really smart people strike out on their own to change the world and do good and yet put out a press release saying how "excited" they are to be working with such an amoral company, it just vacates our idealistic world view.<p>We can't stop Apple selling MacBooks to Monstanto. Apple makes tools and doesn't ask how they get used (nor should it have to). But a small cloud startup, different picture.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; It's an unfortunate sign for HN when the top comment on a thread is such a <i>content-free</i> rant.<p>To the contrary, the tenor of the majority of comments makes it clear that the context is <i>well</i>-understood already, and this is encouraging.<p>Users evidencing a strong moral compass is a reason to rejoice, not despair.<p>If you want some context, try Wikipedia.<p><i>Monsanto is responsible for more than 50 United States Environmental Protection Agency Superfund sites, attempts to clean up Monsanto Chemical's formerly uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.[27]</i><p><i>The Center for Food Safety[108] listed 112 lawsuits by Monsanto against farmers for claims of seed patent violations.[27] The Center for Food Safety's analyst stated that many innocent farmers settle with Monsanto because they cannot afford a time consuming lawsuit. Monsanto is frequently described by farmers as "Gestapo" and "Mafia" both because of these lawsuits and because of the questionable means they use to collect evidence of patent infringement.[27]</i><p>It's a combination of a major environmental polluter and a patent troll.<p><i>Dumping of toxic waste in the UK<p>Between 1965 and 1972, Monsanto paid contractors to illegally dump thousands of tons of highly toxic waste in UK landfill sites, knowing that their chemicals were liable to contaminate wildlife and people. The Environment Agency said the chemicals were found to be polluting groundwater and the atmosphere 30 years after they were dumped.[71]<p>The Brofiscin quarry, near Cardiff, erupted in 2003, spilling fumes over the surrounding area, but the local community was unaware that the quarry housed toxic waste.<p>A UK government report shows that 67 chemicals, including Agent Orange derivatives, dioxins and PCBs exclusively made by Monsanto, are leaking from one unlined porous quarry that was not authorized to take chemical wastes. It emerged that the groundwater has been polluted since the 1970s.[72] The government was criticised for failing to publish information about the scale and exact nature of this contamination. According to the Environment Agency it could cost £100m to clean up the site in south Wales, called "one of the most contaminated" in the UK.[73]</i><p>One thing to remember is that patents are fundamentally at odds with food availability.  You can either have Big Pharma-like profits, or cheap food that feeds billions.<p>As it is, countries with functional governments already overproduce food.  Zimbabwe used to be called the "Breadbasket of Africa" before Mugabe.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105929 href="vote?for=3105929&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105929></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rjstatic">rjstatic</a> 114 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105929">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Paul, while I do see your point, you aren't looking deep enough here.  Please let me explain.<p>Yes, this comment is missing some crucial content, yet, it is not a contentless comment as proven by the up votes.  It is a war cry against those who seek to end this world in a fit of greed. It seems contentless to you because you are unaware of the game Monsanto is playing. I'm not just talking about giving a few kids Asthma by pumping chemicals into the air, I'm talking about risking the collapse of our life support systems for the sake of profit.  Please read up on Monsanto, our survival depends on us to do the right thing. <a href="http://www.right2knowmarch.org/about-2/educational-links/" rel="nofollow">http://www.right2knowmarch.org/about-2/educational-links/</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3106066 href="vote?for=3106066&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6d%33%43%59%35%4b%45%50%6c%57"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3106066></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pbreit">pbreit</a> 114 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3106066">link</a></span></div><br>
