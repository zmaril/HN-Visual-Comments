I didn't consciously realize this till the example of Apple made it clear a few years ago, but market share is actually an unambitious thing to aim for.  When people treat market share as a proxy for profit share, they're implicitly assuming all the competitors are roughly equivalent.  But Apple shows that if your products are sufficiently more desirable than competitors', you can make market share and profit share diverge.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3555158&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3555279 href="vote?for=3555279&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3555279></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=raganwald">raganwald</a> 34 minutes ago  | <a href="item?id=3555279">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Large market share might also lead to more stable profits, though I'd want to look at empirical evidence before saying for sure. Large profits on small market share reeks of an unstable situation, because at least in theory very high margins shouldn't be stable in the face of functioning competitive markets. My guess would be that high profit margins can evaporate overnight more easily than large market share can evaporate overnight (look at how long AOL has been cashing in on the very slow draw-down of its once-large customer base). Though it probably depends on how fast the market typically turns over. On the other hand, arguably Apple is in something of a luxury goods segment, and economists have long recognized that luxury goods operate in strange ways when compared to "normal" neoclassical markets.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3555353&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%35%35%35%31%30%32">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3552424 href="vote?for=3552424&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3552424></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 23 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3552424">link</a> | <a href="item?id=3551684">parent</a> | on: <a href="item?id=3551684">Silicon Valley’s engineering salaries are finally ...</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You can prove it had an effect on the employees that worked there, and to a fairly exact number.  The agreement covered <i>all</i> employees, not just tech workers.  Combined that makes up about 350k employees, and you can then extrapolate how many were engineers in silicon valley, or engineers in general.  That means that there was at least a proportion of the population that was affected very inversely by these agreements.  If you then realize that other companies use the larger more successful companies' salary policies as the model for their own, then it would have impacted other companies as well, and the employees that work there.<p>That alone disproves your implied statement:  That these agreements did nothing to anyone.  It definitely did something, and just the fact that those companies amount to tons of employees and tons of salaries is enough to show it had an effect.<p>You however are pulling the oldest trick in the book.  You want conclusive proof that these completely illegal actions by corporations had a measurable effect before you'll admit that they were wrong.  But, it was a <i>conspiracy</i>. You're not going to get exact numbers.  It's not like these guys are keeping a ledger of money saved by not-poaching.  You are basically demanding the impossible.<p>But, you are also demanding more than you give yourself.  Where's your proof this did nothing?  I know, you didn't explicitly say it did nothing, but that's your clever trick.  You just imply your counter argument and then run around dumping links to logical fallacies on Wikipedia rather than give real numbers.<p>So, Paul, stop being a hypocrite and give us your bet on what impact this really had.  If you demand exact socio-economic evaluations before you'll believe this did anything, then I demand that you give the same evidence it did nothing.<p>And your first task will be to disprove what's already been proven in court:  That these agreements did impact all the employees at these companies, that it did reduce salaries or they wouldn't have bothered, that reducing salaries was their goal, and that they did fire employees over it.<p>Until then, your demand for exact evidence violates the standard in philosophical argument that your own argument can't be used against itself.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3554627&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%35%35%32%34%32%34">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3554880 href="vote?for=3554880&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3554880></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 2 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3554880">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This gave me an interesting thought. You mention that those trading jobs are supposed to be very demanding, implicitly citing this as a reason for their higher salaries. Well, any time a subjective factor like that affects a salary, it is based purely on people's perception of the job. It seems to me that the typical perception of startup work is equally demanding. It's odd that instead of resulting in higher salaries, the benefit is diverted to the (statistically poor) hope of a big IPO or acquisition. This is ironic since the trading firms paying $250k+ to programmers are all about maximizing profits in an environment that could be even more volatile and risky than the startup world. It makes me wonder who has the smarter approach to risk...</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3553688&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%35%35%31%36%38%34">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3553657 href="vote?for=3553657&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3553657></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=keeptrying">keeptrying</a> 13 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3553657">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I agree with this but it's tough to prove that there's a causation effect between the two (other than the one person who was fired, which by itself probably is enough to make a valid argument). But it seems like when the value add of a programmer is so high, it's a lack of mimicking the finance market to structure your compensation package that seems to be more closely correlated to the (low) average income. I say finance market because it's probably one of the few markets where compensation is directly and proportionally related to performance.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3553142&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%35%35%32%34%32%34">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3554695 href="vote?for=3554695&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3554695></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=DasIch">DasIch</a> 3 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3554695">link</a></span></div><br>

(Perfect competition assumes that firms cannot manipulate markets.)<p>Libertarians oppose a government presence in markets because they believe the result is inefficiently functioning markets, and we are all worse off.<p>In this case, the firms collude and are manipulating labor markets so that they behave inefficiently to the advantage of the manipulative firms and disadvantage of labor.

The area will be full of smart well paid people, and will be a place where those people want to live. House prices and rents will go up.<p>2. Since it was aimed at engineers, and prices are (now) expensive, it will tend to be occupied largely by engineers and other highly-paid people.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The expected value of turning down the current offer is almost always positive.  It's very rare for founders to reject an acquisition offer and then later wish they'd taken it.<p>The difference between founders and investors is that founders care about more than just expected value.  A founder with no assets other than his stock in the company will often prefer to sell now and lock in the current price rather than keep rolling the dice.  So to the extent there is a difference between the motivations of founders and investors, it's exactly the opposite of the situation this writer describes.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3548660&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3548803 href="vote?for=3548803&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3548803></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pron">pron</a> 2 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3548803">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The author may very well be wrong about the investors' perspective and the talent-hunt motivation, but he's probably right about who's running the show, and the answer is, invariably, the big companies. Why? Because there just aren't enough successful startup IPOs to keep the entrepreneurs trying. Founders may like risks, but they're not suicidal. The only reason this show is running is that there are plenty of acquisitions at prices that appeal to both entrepreneurs and investors. So if it's big-tech that's running the show, the only question is what's in it for them. The author suggests talent, I think it's market and product research, but one way or another, if big-tech stop acquiring, the startup craze will be over within a day.<p>EDIT:<p>I guess you could say that entrepreneurs and investors are all actually working for Google or IBM or whomever, trying to find the next big thing. They're just not getting a salary but working on a commission. And once in a while, some startup may get away, do an IPO and become a real force, but that's just like an agent on commission starting his own competing business. That's a risk any employer takes.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3548803&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3548964 href="vote?for=3548964&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3548964></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 2 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3548964">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Maybe, but that startup exists in the first place only because the big companies willed it. How did that startup come to be? It got some investment money. And why did anyone invest in it? It wasn't for the hopes of an IPO because the chances are too low. The only reason that startup came to be is because the investors liked the odds of that startup being acquired. Like I said, if tomorrow morning Google, Apple, IBM, Facebook etc. decide they're not buying startups anymore but employing all developers directly and doing their own risky development, the startup scene will vanish in an instant.  So the author is right in that the startups exist to serve the big companies. The reason the big companies don't do that is that they know that true innovation flourishes under perceived freedom. So we all win, but big-tech still wins the most.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3549051&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3550238 href="vote?for=3550238&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3550238></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 1 day ago  | <a href="item?id=3550238">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>OK, so the possibility of an IPO is a necessary condition for investment, but is it sufficient? Would any kind of investor put money in if they think there is a chance of an IPO (with the odds being what they are now) but <i>zero</i> chance for an acquisition? Isn't acquisition the attractive fallback that tilts the odds more favorably? Wouldn't a scenario of no acquisitions stack the odds against the startup so high as to preclude investment?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Like any anti-Google post lately, this one has been reflexively upvoted, but if you look at his reasons for not loving Google, they're pretty thin.  The Kenyan episode was obviously one rogue branch with insufficient oversight; as soon as the guys in Mountain View found out what was going on, they stopped it, and with a minimum of the sort of corporate doublespeak you'd expect from most big companies.  The changes to privacy policies are the sort of thing hackers love to gripe about, but don't actually matter much.  (How many HN readers are going to stop using Google because of them, for example?)  All it really boils down to is that he's mad because his friend got cut off by Adsense.  And it is uncool the way Google just blows people off like that, but it's not new.  They've always been that way.  So if you didn't hate Google 5 years ago, this post offers no reason to hate them now.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3531333&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3532195 href="vote?for=3532195&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3532195></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rickmb">rickmb</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3532195">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Pretty much every company does this.  Your phone company keeps a list of all people you call. (And happily give that list to anyone that asks nicely.) They collect information from your phone about dropped calls and keystrokes.  Retail stores move stuff around and see if it changes your buying habits.  Grocery stores track every item you buy and then have targeted ads print on your receipt.  Amazon changes the price you see based on some profile it has built on you.  Google does nothing worse than any of these companies -- when you have users, you accumulate user data.  You can just leave it lying around for the government to collect, or you can fold it into your product to make it better.  Google uses it to make their products better, and they have written policies on when the data gets anonymized and when the data gets discarded completely.  Does your phone company or grocery store do that?<p>Furthermore, Google is one of the few companies that actively tries to educate you on how they care about your privacy.  There are ads in the subway.  There are ads on TV.  There are ads (right now) on the top of every Google property.  They really want their processes to be transparent so that you know what you're signing up for when you use Google products.  It seems irrational to hate Google when every other Internet company is collecting the same data that Google is, but they hide their policies it behind 300 pages of legalese and Google buys ads to make it easier for you to understand.<p>I think there has to be some deeper issue than "they changed their privacy policy" or "my friends' pictures show up on the results page" that is causing all the Google hate.  Because it just isn't justified for the privacy policy change or Search Plus Your World.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3534498&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3534992 href="vote?for=3534992&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3534992></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=fred_nada">fred_nada</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3534992">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>@jrockway - I know you just started at Google.  Anyway, here are the deeper issues.<p>1. I had mentioned this in another post to you before.  Anyway, some people(not all) are upset because your company said you were better than everyone else. "You can make money without being evil" "What is the best for users?"  All that crap Google said to us and continues to say like it still exists. Google was the poster child of the business of the future.  Everyone felt you were the ones that were actually going to do good.  Facebook/MS/Apple never posed as is this.  You did.  And that is where the anger comes in.  When you are told one thing and the opposite happens people get mad. They should have tried to manage expectations.<p>2. Thousands of businesses depend on your search engine.  With some of them 80% of their business comes from you whether thru paid ads or not.  Many of these companies never would have built their websites if Google didn't exist.  When your company changes things to place their irrelevant content over the content of other websites/companies people are going to be pissed.  What if Apple created their own applications for 50% of the categories in the app store and then placed their apps at the top of each category?  Wouldn't you expect some sort of anger?  Do you think Zynga would be pissed if Facebook placed all of their games higher than Zynga's games?  Its the same thing.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3534992&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3535153 href="vote?for=3535153&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3535153></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jrockway">jrockway</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3535153">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>When you are told one thing and the opposite happens people get mad.</i><p>What is so evil about adding social networking features to everyone's account?  You have a Docs account and a Picasa account too, even if you don't use them, and nobody complains about that.  What's the difference between Docs and Google+?<p><i>Thousands of businesses depend on your search engine.</i><p>This I understand.  People are upset that they have to play with us even though they don't want to.  Nobody likes to do things that they're forced to do.  But this seems like shooting the messenger; it's not Google being evil because users won't use any search engines other than Google.  That's just loyalty to a pretty nice product.<p>Google's customers are the people that click on search results.  So while re-ranking your site may kill your business, you're not a user and that re-ranking makes the experience better for our users.  If the social cues that Google now adds are truly irrelevant as you say, they shouldn't affect users' behavior at all.  Users are not going to stop searching for something to buy just because they have to scroll the results page.  If the social features <i>are</i> relevant, though, then users are getting a better experience.  And that's a good thing, even if individual pages get less traffic from Google.  Instead of being able to SEO the entire Internet, businesses can now only affect the search results for a tiny percentage of users.  That's a good thing because SEO can't scale, and SEO isn't good for users or the Internet at large.<p>If you look at the Google experience from the standpoint of customers, it's pretty good.  Users get relevant search results and ads.  Advertisers get their content on top of everything else.  It's a good compromise between advertising and usability, and it works really well.  It's a bug that you could rank highly in Google without buying ads, and Google is trying to fix the bug.  Manipulating Google results shouldn't be something you feel entitled to be able to do.  If you want to rank highly in Google, be relevant <i>for the user currently searching</i>.  Engage him in social media or email, provide relevant information about what you're selling, and, generally, be a "good match" for what the user wants.<p><i>What if Apple created their own applications for 50% of the categories in the app store and then placed their apps at the top of each category?</i><p>They already do this.  Apple's apps are included for free on every phone.  And you aren't allowed to replicate their functionality, either. It's expectee.  Apple makes phones, Apple gets to put whatever they want on the phones.  Google makes search engine results pages, Google gets to put whatever they want on search engine results pages.<p>This isn't quite the right analogy, though.  I can see why MapQuest would be upset about Google Maps and why Yelp would be upset about Google Local.  But even in those cases, Google ranks things as you'd expect.  Yelp results often appear over the Google business pages, because Yelp is more popular for reviews.  So overall, I don't see Google as being evil.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>SPYW certainly seems like the only real, new issue. It seems to me like a clear case of sacrificing a product's short-term quality for long-term quality. I.e. diverting as much traffic as possible to G+ will drive up usage, which will give Google more data on which to optimize search results.<p>It strikes me as analogous to Apple's move from OS9 to OSX. OSX performed poorly at first, but it was a necessary if painful infrastructure change for the sake of the product's future.<p>Another reason I'm not worried is that Google's only lock-in is search quality. If a challenger appears and really does perform better for searches, then people will eventually shift over. I think this is ultimately what will keep Google from going completely off the rails vis-a-vis search.<p>Conversely, I think it's what allows Facebook to get away with a lot. Its lock-in feature is ubiquity/network-effect, which is at best orthogonal to quality of product.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3531478&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3532460 href="vote?for=3532460&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3532460></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bambax">bambax</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3532460">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; Google believes that without new kinds of input (i.e. social signals) it will not be able to stay ahead of SEO spam and the like over the long haul<p>Assuming you're right, I am very curious as to what research led them to believe that social signals would be that much more beneficial for search results.<p>My own experience with what's on my social dashboards (facebook, google+, and the like) is that it's at best useful for discovery (HN is really good at it and sometimes there are a few gems in the others) but most of the time it's noisy and mediocre content, and more to the point: it's an ecosystem that values popularity above everything else.<p>I'm not trying to sound like a hipster here, and I understand that SEO is also about having your content show as popular in the search engine rankings. But except for communities like HN, most social streams are not regulated by any means.<p>My main concern with SPYW is that I don't want to start having to curate my social graph in order to avoid getting articles from theOnion when I make a query about foreign politics.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3531414&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3532578 href="vote?for=3532578&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3532578></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ZeroGravitas">ZeroGravitas</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3532578">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think there is a lot of "hate" for Google these days, but I believe every bodies reasoning is different.  This is OK, they have alienated so many of their users, but many in a different way.  My current "hate" for google stems from them taking the social away from Google reader,I don't give two Sh!t$ about the policies being merged, I actually think that's a good thing.  Someone else "hates" the new social merged into search.  Honestly, I enjoy diversity in the services I use online.  I want my music to be independent from my email to be independent from my "social network" (not to be confused with my "personal network", of which, email is a part of) I don't like what google has become, and if I wasn't firmly planted and reliant on gmail, I'd be google product free.  RSS, search, and cloud storage are all now solved for me elsewhere, and social always has been.  I'm sticking with gmail, because I'm not anti-google, and it's a fantastic product, but I've left google products because somethign better came along (dropbox killed any need for google docs, google killed their RSS as far as I'm concerned, and G+ never really did it for me (or any of my actual friends, although I've got thousands of followers, they're all from the HN circle...)  Did I mention that I revel in diversity to keep my mind engaged and learning new things.  I don't want my entire experience to be from google or facebooks window, I want wide open spaces of internet and applications.  If you know what I mean.<p>This is going to turn into a larger rant on the the course of "social media" and their networks.  When I'm with certain groups of friends, I act and talk in a certain way, and by no means should some of that ever be public.  I want to talk and communicate with some of the social group of mine online, but in no way shape or form should any of that be public as well.  Many people can't make that distinction (hence the UK people being deported because of tweets) and I think the big companies are trying to ruin that divide between public and private.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3534286&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3531401 href="vote?for=3531401&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3531401></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=thaumaturgy">thaumaturgy</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3531401">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#5a5a5a>Well I think a lot of where Google crosses the line is becoming clearer now.  For example, personalized ads in gmail.  Try to opt-out of personalized ads in gmail, seriously go and try it.<p>You can click the button, but they won't actually opt you out.  At least not how you'd expect.  You'll still get personalized ads, but they just use a different heuristic for how to personalize (based on the current email).<p>How hard is it to not personalize my ads at all?  It would be easy.

I'm talking specifically about the "option" of opting out of personalized (and there is a well hidden option that Google has for this), but it only changes the algorithm.  You still get personalized ads.<p>When I signed up for GMail when it first opened, this was not the case.<p><i>&#62;&#62; Haven't made the switch yet, but I'm seriously considering it.<p>Yeah... sure</i><p>Is this hard to believe?  I just created a hotmail account.  I need to try it on all my devices first.  And then of course get my forwarding accounts switched to it.  If all goes well I'll switch.  The main concern is lack of imap so I'll use Exchange ActiveSync -- but since I don't generally use that today, I need to make sure it works fine.<p>But there was a time when GMail was untouchable.
