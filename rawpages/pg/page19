They could be mistakes, or artifacts of limitations that have since disappeared.<p>(It's particularly useful for startups to notice the latter, incidentally.  A lot of existing businesses turn out to be artifacts of limitations that have since disappeared.  E.g. hotels are to some extent a hack to get around the fact that it used to be impossible to search all the available space in the city you wanted to visit.  If you built a whole building full of bedrooms, you could afford to pay to advertise it and to pay someone to work full time taking reservations.)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3142991 href="vote?for=3142991&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3142991></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=eru">eru</a> 106 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3142991">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think it's interesting how the Yelp model might work for business services, but breaks down for service providers. We're not doing lawyers, but I think lawyers are a good example of why the Yelp UX model is wrong for the "relationship" business services market.<p>- First, reviews are the wrong content. You won't get them, first of all, because customers of businesses who see 10-20 engagements per year will never leave lukewarm or negative reviews. Secondly, even if you only allow recommendations (like LinkedIn) and not open reviews, it's still the wrong content to describe a complex business service. The managing partner of WSGR has tons of recommendations on LI. Does one of them come close to capturing how he thinks about business or his potential value? No.<p>- Second, stars or any other standard comparison ranking system is the wrong discovery method. Stars help people discover who is good, but not who is good at what.<p>- Third, participation. LawPivot, who was able to raise several million dollars, lets lawyers generate business through a private Q&#38;A site. Well, the most successful lawyers have no reason to use this service- they are already oversubscribed. Any service discovery/review tool dependent on active participation by the service providers leaves out the best players. This is less of a concern for the B2Brevs of the world, but describes why Guru.com and Elance became talent slums.<p>I probably shouldn't say anything, but we're launching (and applied YCW12) with something designed to fill a number 2 role for an often overlooked class of business services.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3132199 href="vote?for=3132199&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3132199></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=akkartik">akkartik</a> 109 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3132199">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Oddly enough Drew and I talked about this question tonight on a panel at the Computer History Museum.  It was a big risk to recruit someone as a cofounder that he didn't know before (and I've seen a lot of cases where it didn't work out) but in this case the risk was mitigated by how much they had in common.<p>One thing they had in common was Kyle Vogt of Justin.tv, who introduced them.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Even if the roulette ball drops into the slot 00, the play was still a "big risk", and so was, under the circumstances, insisting on a cofounder.  That is, given how much Drew had already done, a cofounder had to be mostly just downside risk.  The 'mitigation' had to be minimal.<p>Or, Drew's left hand doesn't fight with his right hand, but cofounders can easily fight.<p>If a cofounder is really needed, then so be it.  But a cofounder is always risky, and a single founder who has already done well starting the business has a big advantage just because his left hand won't fight with his right hand.<p>Now a single founder can do much more than in past years, even just five years ago.<p>And here's a big point:  always in a startup very much want the CEO to 'understand his business'.  In an IT software startup, that includes understanding the software.  But software has now changed:  E.g., with .NET, nearly everything needed in commercial computing, and a larger fraction of Web site construction, is already in the .NET classes.  So, the work is just writing a little 'glue' code between the uses of the classes.  So, the coding goes VERY quickly.  But what doesn't go quickly is understanding the classes because need about 10 books each of 500-1000 pages and, even for just a Web site, about 3000 Web pages of documentation from MSDN.  And, this understanding of .NET is just 'overhead' that have to pay just once per programming task solved with a .NET class actually understand well.  So, to 'know his business', a CEO needs to know the relevant parts of, say, .NET.  A cofounder can't help here.  And once the CEO does have that .NET knowledge, there can be some serious question if a cofounder can add much.  Just what the Linux world has in place of .NET I don't know, but it can't be both small and effective.<p>There is other evidence:  Look up and down Main Street at the successful businesses that have been started there.  Typically there's only one person who is the real 'founder'.  Look at research:  Bright ideas come first to just one person at a time.  Period.  Microsoft:  A Bill Gates show.  Apple:  A Steve Jobs show.  Berkshire:  A Warren Buffett show.  Renaissance:  A James Simons show.  Continue with the one man shows of Kolmogorov, von Neumann, Knuth, etc. and in music Heifetz, Rostropovich, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, etc.<p>It's tough enough to find a Michelangelo to paint the ceiling.  Getting him a 'copainter' who would actually help would be impossible.  As you add people to a team, the team regresses to the mean where you don't want to be.  And, did I mention fights?

<span class="comment"><font color=#aeaeae>Sure, Woz helped get Apple started.  Then with that start, Jobs had cash that helped him at Next and Pixar and back at Apple where he worked for $1 a year.  So, Jobs was really the 'founder' of the success at Next, Pixar, and the Apple we know today.  Your point is just that the early success at Apple gave Jobs cash.  With cash, Jobs was a wildly successful sole founder at Next, Pixar, and his return to Apple where the cash was relevant but not the early Apple or Woz.<p>The issue is, can a sole founder be successful?  The evidence from Jobs at Next, Pixar, and Apple upon his return is, with cash, yes.  So, just for the people involved, Jobs is a great example of a successful sole founder in his last three gigs.<p>You are bending over backwards to refuse to see this.  Why don't you go on and say that the iPod was due to his mother while you are at it?<p>Again, yet again, so that even you might be able to get it, is Jobs, with some cash, was three times a successful sole founder.  That's the issue:  A sole founder, and three times he was.

<span class="comment"><font color=#aeaeae>You are just flatly refusing to pay any informed attention at all to history or to read what the heck I actually wrote.<p>Take Gates:  When Allen was still around, Microsoft was a still a small company IBM was still laughing at.  Then Allen left.  Gates, it was JUST Gates, went on to build Windows 3, Office, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows NT, IE, Windows Server, SQL Server, Windows XP, and more.  Gates grew his fortune from a few hundred million dollars to $50 billion or so.  That growth was due to Gates.  Period.  And that was the significant growth that blew the doors off IBM, Sun, HP, Lotus, etc.  Got it now?<p>For Jobs, you are really working to be brain-dead:  What Woz and Jobs did with the Apple II, etc. is nearly irrelevant to what Jobs did at Next, Pixar, and after his return to Apple.  Apple became for a while the most valuable company in the world due to what Jobs did, Jobs, JUST Jobs, with Woz watching from the nickel seats.  Sculley?  Amelio?  They just helped show how bright Jobs was.<p>For your "would have never made it to where they got", we have no way to know that.<p>You are illustrating a huge point that I did make:  People like to fight.  Even over something really obvious, people like to fight.  If you and I were cofounders, then no matter what I did and no matter what success the company was having, you'd be fighting me every way you could think of, fighting, fighting, fighting, for no good reason except you just want to be fighting.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Without Woz apple would have never happened, because he designed their first flagship product. What Woz did back then is highly relevant because it was the thing that eventually enabled Jobs to start Next and buy Pixar.<p>Jobs and Woz to me are the ideal example of the sum being <i>much</i> greater than either part.<p>Without Paul Allen Microsoft as we know it would not have existed because he <i>named</i> Microsoft Microsoft.<p>Your insulting tone and capitals do not make you right, they're reminiscent of people raising their voice and making things personal just because they can't win an argument.<p>I read a bit in your comment history and this seems to be a recurring theme for you, it is almost as if you take this single founder thing personal. The way to prove that it works is to simply succeed. As a single founder myself I've been there, I've done the multiple-founder thing too (with mixed success). There are no guarantees, to pretend either way is a shoe-in is nonsense. But statistically speaking, and looking at things from the point of view of a guy or girl considering going it alone or from the point of view of an investor that has the choice to invest in a company founded by one or more people the statistics seem to point to more being the better choice. Exceptions will always happen. But the ones that you point to are not those exceptions.<p>We can't know anything about pasts and futures that didn't happen, but we can safely say that things that did happen and that were likely significant were at least as significant as anything that you think would have happened otherwise. Jobs, Wozniak, Gates and Allen would probably never have said what you just said, and that alone marks them as potentially more successful. How you interact with others is an important factor in your chances for success, and being able to give credit where credit is due is another.<p>I agree that you and I should not be involved in any business because we'd probably fight, and you are making that point very eloquently.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3130372 href="vote?for=3130372&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3130372></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=NY_Entrepreneur">NY_Entrepreneur</a> 109 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3130372">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#737373>"Without Paul Allen Microsoft as we know it would not have existed because he named Microsoft Microsoft."<p>So he named the company?  Now you are being totally silly and showing that you are determined to fight with me for just silly reasons.<p>You are the one being 'personal'.  You just don't want the argument made that sole founders can be a good bet and just want to stay with the PG and VC herd that cofounders are crucial, say, for naming the company and cut me down for not joining your herd.<p>Jobs was a successful sole founder at Next, Pixar, and his return to Apple.  The only role from Woz and Jobs's first time at Apple was just cash, not Woz or a 'cofounder'.  You are straining to deny that Jobs was successful in his last three gigs as a sole founder.<p>Gates?  He had to refound the company after the success of MS/DOS and make Windows, Windows Server, SQL Server, and Office all real.  He did.  Alone.  While doing this, IBM was laughing at him.  He knocked the socks off IBM, DB2, Lotus, WordPerfect, Sun, HP, and more.<p>Just look around you:  Commonly cofounders and coleaders just suck.  Big committees suck.  Group decision making sucks.  Take IBM, AT&#38;T, GM, Sun, HP:  In each case, the management suite and top management 'team' was awash in what was regarded as the best qualifications.  Still, they all just sucked.  The Navy knows better:  On the bridge of a ship, there exactly one captain.  Although one captain can be bad, two is usually worse.<p>Then you are ignoring the present for what is central at HN:  IT startups, especially Web 2.0 startups.  Elsewhere on this thread I've explained in good detail:  A founder needs to understand his business; he needs to understand the software; the bottleneck in understanding the software is not the unique software of the company but just understanding the now huge software components available; that bottleneck can be passed by just one person at a time, essentially alone, or learning is not a spectator sport or a team sport; once a founder has passed this bottleneck, a cofounder becomes much less relevant than in the past.  You can see this, if you want to.<p>The main issue here is sole founders or cofounders.  The resolution is, net, having all the business between one pair of ears is a great advantage when it can be done, and now for a Web 2.0 startup it not only can be done but should be done.  The 'team' of Michelangelo and anyone else would be nowhere nearly as good at painting the ceiling as just Michelangelo alone.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=320></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3131210 href="vote?for=3131210&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3131210></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Impossible">Impossible</a> 109 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3131210">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>No one is denying that Gates,Jobs and Buffett accomplished incredible feats. I'm just arguing that, at the beginning, each had a partner to help get things started. Woz created the Apple 1 and 2 which brought incredible financial success to Apple allowing Jobs to later start Next and purchase Pixar from Lucas. Paul Allen was instrumental Microsoft's early days including coding Microsoft Basic and making deals. Gates had the chance to then operate from a strong position to grow Microsoft and lock in that monopoly. Warren Buffett has always said that he didn't create Bershire alone and that Charlie Munger (as well as Benjamin Graham) helped immensely.<p>I am currently a single founder and I disagree with the idea that you must have a co-founder to be successful. I'm just arguing that if you want to use Gates,Jobs and Buffett as your examples of single founders they don't hold up well.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3129890 href="vote?for=3129890&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3129890></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ridruejo">ridruejo</a> 109 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3129890">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#888888>Sure.  Still, what I said is on target:  Gates, Jobs, etc. did the big, huge growth just from their own brains.  There's no good reason to believe that they could not have done all of the success, including the first days, essentially alone also.<p>Really, for the "early stages of a business", that is JUST what Jobs faced at Next, Pixar, and back at Apple.  What he and Woz did for the Apple II was nearly irrelevant except it did leave Jobs with the cash from his sale of all his Apple stock except one shart.  So, we're not talking the value of a cofounder but the value of a founder with cash!<p>And for Gates, as MS/DOS took off, Microsoft was just awash in cash.  About then, Allen left.  So, the real building of Microsoft was due to Gates and cash.  It's not the least bit clear that Gates ever really needed Allen as a cofounder.  Similarly for Jobs and Woz.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3146507 href="vote?for=3146507&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3146507></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ridruejo">ridruejo</a> 105 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3146507">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#737373>"would they have been able to without the support of the other half?"  The evidence overwhelmingly, yes they would have been successful.  You are correct that Gates, Jobs, and Buffett are not perfect examples of successful sole founders, but the question is, can a sole founder be successful?  The 'rub' in this question is, can just one guy, alone, making all the decisions alone, do well?  Then the examples of Gates, Jobs, and Buffett are quite relevant because each did great things essentially alone.<p>For Jobs, whatever might say about Woz and Jobs's first period at Apple, later Jobs did very well alone at Next, Pixar, and back at Apple.  For those last three gigs, Woz was somewhere in the nickel seats.  Yes, the success with Woz gave Jobs a lot of cash that was no doubt important for him in his last three gigs.  So, then we say that Jobs is an example of a three time successful sole founder with cash.  So, with cash a sole founder can work.<p>After the success of MS/DOS and Allen leaving Microsoft, Gates really had to reinvent, 'refound' the company.  It is fair to say that he was a founder again.  Yes, he was a founder with cash, but he was still acting essentially alone.  Again, the issue is, can a sole founder do it alone, and that is what we are addressing.  With the cash from MS/DOS, Gates did it alone.  It's amazing what he did because he crushed IBM, Sun, Lotus, Netscape, DB2, and more.<p>For Buffett, no way should we count Ben Graham!  He wrote a book and was a prof of Buffett at Columbia and possibly a friend.  Graham had likely hundreds of students and millions of readers, but there was just one Berkshire.  So, for Berkshire I don't credit Graham.<p>For Munger's role, that's just a judgment call, but my reading is that Buffett didn't much need him.  Partly I draw that conclusion because it appears in recent years Buffett has been making his decisions essentially just alone.<p>Again, the main issue is, can a sole founder really get the work done or will he go off the deep end, for fast women, slow horses, cheap booze, wacko ideas, etc.?  Well, Gates, Jobs, and Buffett didn't do any of these bad things.<p>There's another great example:  Fred Smith at FedEx.  I absolutely, positively guarantee you that there I know in fine detail just what the heck I'm talking about:  FedEx was due almost entirely just to Smith, not Art Bass, Roger Frock, Mike Basch, ..., or me.   Yes, it's true that Smith had a fortune from Southern Greyhound.<p>But with a fortune, it's easy, right?  Tell that to Carly Fiorina, John Akers, Gil Amelio, Pat Dunn, etc.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3130874 href="vote?for=3130874&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3130874></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=herbacidal">herbacidal</a> 109 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3130874">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Drew's case shows how hard it is to generalize.  We're generally reluctant to fund single founders.  And yet the most successful startup we've funded had a single founder at the time he applied:<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27532820/app.html" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/27532820/app.html</a><p>We strongly encouraged Drew to get a cofounder, and he found Arash before the summer 2007 cycle began.  Arash turned out to be the perfect cofounder.  So Dropbox is pretty much the best case scenario for a single founder applying to YC.  And the variation in startup outcomes is so great that even though we have such a large data set, the best single founder outcome is so far better than any of the multiple founder outcomes.<p>This is why one of our rules is that we'll break any of our rules.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3127762 href="vote?for=3127762&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3127762></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=0x12">0x12</a> 109 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3127762">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>That application is a joy to read.<p>One answer stands out for me, it probably was instrumental in the eventual success for dropbox:<p><pre><code>  # Do any founders have other commitments between June and August 2007 inclusive?  
  &#62; No; I've given notice at Bit9 to work on this full time regardless of YC funding.
</code></pre>
That's really great. Drew had already decided to push ahead, with or without YC, he basically positioned himself to negotiate from strength, in turn increasing his chances of getting funded by YC.<p>That's showing a lot of business savvy there. Instead of coming 'cap in hand' he's telling YC: "If you want on board you may, but the train will run regardless."</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3127916 href="vote?for=3127916&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3127916></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 109 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3127916">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I second this. At first I was against the hiding of points for the reasons others have stated: to show good comments.<p>In reality you would get situations where someone would post a thoughtful and well-reasoned comment (2 points) and someone would reply with a very minor correction (12 points).<p>It also seemed like "wars" were fought over points too, purely anecdotally.<p>My own experience is that voting now seems to be more rational. People seem to upvote when something should be upvoted (my guess is that this topped out before if someone thought a comment had too many votes). When something is negative, it's indicated so it doesn't tend to get downvoted into oblivion.<p>As for curating interesting comments to the top, this happens now and seems to work quite well.<p>I just wish there was a way to:<p>- Look at comments you haven't seen yet; and<p>- Filter comments by "quality", sorta like Slashdot has. The meaning of this can be vague and "quality" doesn't have to be a straight point measure but I'd like to see a way to just see the best comments, particularly when there are 300+ comments.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3123154 href="vote?for=3123154&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3123154></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=redthrowaway">redthrowaway</a> 110 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3123154">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The problem is that a simple up/down vote system is too crude.<p>- low effort for drive-by downmods (there are stupid numbers of comments blasted to nothing despite being insightful or informative)<p>- upvote doesn't distinguish between 'I agree' and 'hey, this is really informative'; the former is mostly meaningless, the latter is useful<p>- single downmod diminishes what you said and makes it harder to read (on an already low-contrast site). Hardly fair given the ease of 'drive-bys'.<p>The forum I spend most of my time on has a reason required for the mod - it's not this brainless +/- system that the web is moving towards. You get an idea <i>why</i> people are up/downmodding, <i>and</i> it raises the bar ever so slightly so that it takes actual effort to mod (that is, critique) a comment. The displayed point value is also capped - while the user gets the karma for the mod, it's not displayed beyond a certain cap.<p>Mostly I see the benefit of this system as stopping mindless up/downvoting - requiring the tiniest bit of effort produces better quality results. Still not perfect, but much, much better.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3124996 href="vote?for=3124996&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3124996></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Corrado">Corrado</a> 110 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3124996">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Requesting a reason for a mod via an associated dropdown is not hard for anyone to understand - and I would expect users of "Hacker News" to be able to figure it out even if it were slightly difficult.<p>The "lightweight feedback" is "throwaway feedback", because you really only see how unpopular a comment is (is it dead yet? oop! there it goes!). Only the owner knows how popular it is, and even then, doesn't know if it's just a bunch of 'yeah, me too!' or 'that was informative or insightful!'<p>The most egregious example of 'why is this modded so' is this comment, so much so that I've stuck it in my profile:<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3087822" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3087822</a><p>The thread was about RMS and what an eccentric he is, and about his comments subsequent to Steve Jobs' death. The comment is defending RMS using an oft-quoted verse of Jobs', where he defends mavericks making their own rules and violating the status quo. The comment makes a very insightful link, and is not offensive or malicious. Yet it's downmodded to dead status, something that other comments in the same thread didn't have happen despite being much more fractious. Why was it downmodded? Who can say? It's probably fanboys, nothing else makes sense from a mature point of view.<p>Which reminds me of another issue with the mod system: it's totally anonymous. There is no accountability. You can diminish someone else's statement without giving a reason why nor standing behind it with your own name/pseudonym. Again, the forum I come from gives you the option to see who modded a comment whichever way - which while there is the occasional problem, is overall a significant net gain for an online community that strives to keep things mature.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3125072 href="vote?for=3125072&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3125072></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=eddmc">eddmc</a> 110 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3125072">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>So, I actually think dlss is making a very valuable point here: the argument that many people are making with relation to hiding point totals, is that if you can see the number of points a post has, it may affect whether you decide to vote at all: you may go "oh, that's already high enough, I won't bother voting".<p>In essence, people have a mental concept of how high or low they feel posts they are looking at are, and adjust, possibly very subtly, possibly without even realizing it in a way that they would explain if asked, their behavior to cause the post to hit that target, as opposed to showing their true interest with an up/down.<p>(For a reference on users discussing this effect, and some commentary from PG about having seen this effect on the high end of comment karma scores, see this example thread from another post: <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2465271" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2465271</a> .)<p>How peoples' behaviors change is complex. On the one hand, you may see "your side" heavily lower than "the opposition", and decide "ugh, it's pointless". On the other, you may go "ok, that's just not fair", or "help out the team", and make extra certain to vote on that specific poll.<p>Due to these attitudes, which are pretty much the same things that are driving the changes in behavior with respect to comment voting, you don't get accurate information with public live polls. This really is the same effect, and should be thought of and treated the same.<p>Now, making the entire poll /permanently/ only visible to the poster would mean, as you say, that the poll becomes meaningless. However, I would say that's a strawman: there are numerous other ways to handle the situation that still make sense.<p>Example: polls could be private until they "time out", at which point the poll is no longer votable on, and the data becomes public. Frankly, this seems correct, and I'm glad dlss brought it up (although apparently people disagree with the way he worded it or something, which seems silly).<p>(I also think that this behavior would dovetail very well with "show the comment scores after people can no longer vote on them", which came up elsewhere in the comments for this post: <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3122362" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3122362</a> .)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3123604 href="vote?for=3123604&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3123604></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pbhjpbhj">pbhjpbhj</a> 110 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3123604">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62;Social proofs are bad. You should be reading the comments and then deciding what is interesting and noteworthy [...]<p>Respectfully, I disagree.<p>Its a core idea of this site, that the community does a good job of surfacing interesting interesting content; what appears on the front page is what has been upvoted sufficiently.  I presume you wouldn't argue that HN users should read all submissions, and decide what is interesting and noteworthy for themselves.<p>You have a point, in that there may be feedback effect with comments.<p>Personally, I don't think that a comment being highly rated seriously effects my judgement of its content.  It does, however, draw my attention to that comment.<p>I would argue that comment scores should not be optimised to give the most accurate rating to comments, so much as to filter comments - e.g. draw attention to comments that are interesting, and might otherwise be overlooked.<p>As such, if there is positive feedback in good comments being 'overvoted' I don't see a problem.<p>I accept that this is a subjective perspective, determined by what I want from HN.  I want to use the smart community here to quickly learn important information, and gain insight; as such, I don't really care whether comment scores are 'correct', so much as whether they are useful.<p>As others have said, the ability to see the wider community's aggregated opinion on a particular set of conflicting comments, is also useful, where I lack the expertise to evaluate them myself - but I wouldn't be casting any votes, in such a situation.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3122926 href="vote?for=3122926&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3122926></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=0x12">0x12</a> 110 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3122926">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'd appreciate having the bins that you mentioned. My issue is that often times I see a parent comment being corrected by a child comment.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You misinterpreted my comment. I wasn't looking to comment scores as a measure of "correctness". Hell, I can find out correctness on my own by actually researching the topic. I used comment-scores as a measure of consensus. That is, after all, exactly what it is.<p>Simple example:<p>&#62; Ask HN: What's the best way to perf-test my server?<p>&#62; comment X: <i>I use httperf, it has great features and is very robust.</i><p>&#62; comment Y: <i>Check out Apache Benchmark (ab).</i><p>There is a huge difference between whether comment X is marginally higher than comment Y (i.e. it has slightly more upvotes), compared to if it's a factor of 2-5 or more. In the former scenario, I know to spend an equal amount of time evaluating both, while for the latter scenario, I know one project has much greater user-adoption among the HN community than the other (or at least more passionate adoption).<p>Likewise, if a comment thread has a question that has 50 upvotes, then many more people seem to be interested in that particular facet than another question with 3 upvotes.<p>My point is that comment points provide an additional form of context. I actually want to know "what the cool kids think", because that in itself is useful info. In most cases, I take it with a grain of salt, but that's really up to me. If other people misinterpreting comment points, or abusing them, means I can't have them... well, that's a shame. HN will continue to be the fraction of its former self for me.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3123970 href="vote?for=3123970&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3123970></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mechanical_fish">mechanical_fish</a> 110 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3123970">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The problem with your logic is the sample population. What is the "HN Community", if we define it as "the set of people who click a vote button within a given topic"? It's a nonuniform cross-section of God Knows Who Is Using HN At This Hour.<p>It isn't even a representative sample of "what the cool kids think". Even cool kids get bored with repetition. For example, once upon a time almost every XKCD got linked on the HN home page, but due to tacit agreement (and, perhaps, intervention by Our Invisible Friends The Moderators) this almost never happens anymore. And yet everyone I know continues to routinely read XKCD. It's not uncool or anything. It's just no longer new.<p>Similarly, Lisp and Erlang make far fewer guest appearances on the HN homepage. Should I conclude that these things are now uncool? No, just that time has marched on, and HN has grown and changed, and the makeup of its increasingly gigantic audience has shifted.<p>If you want to take a poll you should try to find someone who takes polling seriously. Otherwise you're better off with un-numerated anecdotes.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Why bother having a voting system at all, then? Karma that can only be seen on the user's page is simply just point-scoring. Sure, you gain minor functionality increases with karma, but you could do exactly the same thing with comment count for comments that aren't flagged (since you need to comment to get karma anyway)<p>Just give people a way to flag inappropriate comments, and then you've got pretty much the same system as we currently have. Early comments stay up the top, and there is no way to tell which has engaged the community apart from volume of response. Inappropriate comments get flagged and with enough flags they die. Get enough unflagged comments under your belt, and you're 'participating' and are then allowed the escalated priveleges.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3122710 href="vote?for=3122710&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3122710></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=mixmax">mixmax</a> 110 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3122710">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>which is of course a good reason.<p>The problem is that there are some rather heavy casualties that come from not showing points.<p>- It's very hard, if not impossible to scan a thread for good comments. Busy people don't have time to read through a whole thread to pick out the good comments.<p>- I did a back of the envelope calculation here: <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2569997" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2569997</a> that shows that there is no way to assess the scores of around 50% of the comments. If there isn't a good way of assessing which comments are deemd good by the community is the system working properly?<p>- When a poster postulates something and is refuted by a sibling it's impossible to know who is right. Points give you a gauge of what HN as a community thinks. For instance, if a user comments that you should always use Bcrypt and a sibling replies that this is simply wrong I don't know what is right and wrong, even though it may be obvious to someone knowledgeable in encryption. Points give you a good header.<p>- When you don't show points people tend to vote less. Without having seen the numbers I'm confident that voting has decreased significantly. If noone is voting (or even worse, only a subset of opiniated users vote) then we're back to a threaded discussion ordered by randomness.<p>- As I remember it one of the original reasons for hiding points was to stop the "piling on" where already popular comments got more upvotes. You posted at some point that comments which had a lot of points before actually have <i>more</i> points after the don't-show-points change.<p>Hiding scores to reduce arguments seems like a very crude and inelegant way of solving the problem. You solve one problem but effectively render the scoring system useless in the process.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3123196 href="vote?for=3123196&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3123196></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=alok-g">alok-g</a> 110 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3123196">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I, too, found myself susceptible to reactions based on karma score and, personally, it wouldn't bother me at all if the scores never come back. If given the ability to view karma scores, I would leave them off, since I'm self-aware enough to realize that -- when karma scores are enabled -- my comments are of a lower caliber.<p>However, I'm not against allowing users with a certain level of karma the choice to view karma scores on threads if they really feel that HN is better with karma on, which it seems like a fairly large subset of users (or at least a significantly vocal one) wish for. I think that StackOverflow's successful moderation policies (and, to a lesser extent, HNs own) have sufficiently demonstrated that extraordinary members of a community can handle the responsibilities that come with increased privilege.<p>For example, I suspect that, if pg allowed individuals with high karma, such as yourself, to choose to toggle an option such as "view karma scores", no flood of dumb comments from high karma individuals would suddenly manifest. Further, I think that the transition from default karma displayed to our current situation has allowed anyone who has invested significant time in the community an opportunity for introspection that wasn't previously available. I'm now able to evaluate, personally, how my comments and behavior were effected by the display of karma and I'm less susceptible to the psychological effects as a result.<p>Of course, even if there isn't a significant negative aspect to allowing high karma individuals to view karma scores, it's still hardly worthwhile unless there's some kind of positive impact as a result. Perhaps mollifying the community would be enough of a benefit? Maybe a more pro show-karma individual would be better qualified to comment on the potential upside. My feeling is that it's possible that some subset of HNers exist whose experience with the community is improved by having karma scores enabled and, as such, it would be beneficial to allow them the possibility of a choice.<p>P.S.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>While this might be true "by volume", I would be very surprised if it were true "by weight". The first thing I do when I'm looking at a new library, daemon, service, company, or really almost anything at this point, is go to Hacker News to see if anyone has mentioned it in the past, and what their take on it was during that discussion.<p>As an example, when I got interested in GitHub last year (note: I mean as "what are they doing in this space and where are they going", not "what does it do"), I seriously went to searchyc and went through the Hacker News archives chronologically, skimming every single thread that has ever talked about it; it took days, but it was incredibly worth the time.<p>This has become such a resource for this sort of thing, that I've been trying to "get to know" the people I interact with here, building a tagging framework (browser extensions) that I can use to add little notes to users, allowing me to get a better feel for who they are, rather than some anonymous user: if nothing else, it helps me remember at all times that these are real people whom I am interacting with ;P.<p>So yeah, I guess I'm rambling now, but what I'm trying to say is: the archives are important. They may not be something you use every day, but when you do find a reason to use them it is one of the most valuable resources I currently know of, and I have to see it labeled as something that there is no point in improving due to "lack of use".</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3122478 href="vote?for=3122478&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%4e%32%38%73%78%62%30%4b%4c%53"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3122478></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bryanh">bryanh</a> 111 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3122478">link</a></span></div><br>

The site founder, pg, asked for suggestions on how to "stave off decline of HN" in a thread he opened 197 days ago.<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2403696</a><p>He then announced and experiment of not showing comment karma scores 189 days ago,<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2434333" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2434333</a><p>noting that he might change settings back and forth as the experiment continued. 186 days ago he opened a simple yes/no poll about the experiment<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2445039" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2445039</a><p>and 180 days ago he replied to a question with a preliminary report on how voting behavior has changed,<p><a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2465271" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2465271</a><p>and now today he has said that he is satisfied with the results of the experiment.
