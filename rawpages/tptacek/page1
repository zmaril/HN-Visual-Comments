<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This is the part I was referring to:<p><pre><code>   In a nutshell, it gives each signatory authority to 
   create laws that satisfy ACTA's requirements. Without 
   getting into the issue of monism and dualism 
   (international legal concepts for how treaties embed 
   themselves into domestic law) it simply means that until 
   signatory states create enforcing legislation, ACTA does 
   nothing.
   
   An example would be that, once passed, a US federal act 
   that enforces ACTA is immune from challenges over states 
   rights (though not bill of rights challenges). To be 
   frank this isn't too controversial, there is nothing in 
   ACTA that doesn't satisfy the inter-state commerce 
   clause anyway.
   
   So undersand that ACTA isn't really the issue. What 
   people need to be prepared for is how states implement 
   it, which is where scope for abuse is.</code></pre></font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3543977&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%74%70%74%61%63%65%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3543765 href="vote?for=3543765&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%74%70%74%61%63%65%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3543765></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 3 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3543765">link</a> | <a href="item?id=3543724">parent</a> | on: <a href="item?id=3543469">A Peek Inside the Insane Philosophy of the Central...</a></span></div><br>

It was a matter of 'national security' that no one outside of the negotiating body could see it... except copyright lobbyists.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The reality is that both are true - there was an "HTTP Object Model" that TBL and Roy Fielding had in mind in the 90s, but it was never formalized until Roy's thesis.   Not everyone on the various IETF and W3C committees understood or agreed with it, clearly, and there are a lot of hacks in practice.  There were attempts like HTTP-NG to supplant HTTP with CORBA-like Object RPC, but the arguments against this were basically informal arguments in favour of the uniform interface of URI + HTTP + MIME.   Even today, the current HTML5 leads don't particularly seem to have much appreciation for the style.<p>That said, starting with the Apache web server, Roy had a lot of control with its architecture and approach to supporting particular HTTP features, using his mental model of the "Web's architectural style" to guide it.  After 2000 and the thesis, there are many people that started implementing their clients and servers with the style as a philosophical guide.<p>The style also tends to be widely misunderstood and buzzword-ified, which is scammy.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3539608&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%74%70%74%61%63%65%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3539641 href="vote?for=3539641&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%74%70%74%61%63%65%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3539641></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3539641">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think what you're hearing me express is skepticism that the (self-appointed) elite that makes standards or writes dissertations about architecture is in any way the final word on what constitutes the web. Without the hundreds of thousands of crappy applications that actually populate the web, it would be an academic exercise.<p>Regardless of what the RFC says, the CGI interface that provided the foundation for the original wave of web apps was just a series of getenv()'s. It was absolutely not the case that web developers in 1995 were careful to make sure that they represented state consistently or provided discoverable resources. Then as now, most web applications (and APIs, where they existed) were black boxes with parameters defined by expediency.<p>Also, even Fielding doesn't claim that RPC interfaces are <i>wrong</i>. He seems to have a much bigger (and more reasonable) problem with people pretending that RPC interfaces are REST. There are plenty of interfaces that make just as much sense in RPC as they would in REST; it's not unlikely that there are plenty of them that make <i>more</i> sense expressed as RPC.<p>I also don't understand the emotional appeal.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thomas, sorry.<p>I would actually think Roy (and the actual elite that built HTTP in the 90s) would agree with you on your first point - he defines REST, but that doesn't define the Web, which is hundreds of thousands of scrappy applications.  REST was intended to cover the common case of the Web so that the standards themselves will be optimized to the common case.   The "self appointed" elite are wrong to suggest that REST <i>is</i> the Web, but to me it's just as wrong to suggest that REST doesn't provide a useful abstract model of what makes the web work.<p>Regarding CGI, yeah, it was a hack, and it worked.   But look at how website design evolved -- sometimes those websites sucked because they changed URIs all the time breaking bookmarks, search engines, etc.   These practices weren't thought of in academic terms, no, but the point is that there was a theory underlying what emergent properties made websites good and popular (stable URIs for example, which led to better search, and bookmarking), which led to mainstream aphorisms like "cool URIs don't change" in the 97-98 timeframe.  This was eventually codified academically in Roy's thesis a few years later.   My point is that this wasn't completely accidental, there were people actively advocating "good practices" in the 90s, even without a formal published theory - it was informally understood by those who were on the mailing lists.<p>And I agree, RPC isn't wrong, the point is that it is fundamentally flawed approach if your goal is interoperability at a global scale.   If you want client A to talk to server B, have at it, just don't call it REST or assume you'll get the desirable properties.  Many so-called REST APIs aren't globally interoperable due to this conceptual baggage, but some are better than others.<p>As for the emotional appeal, my point is... these debates have been discussed ad nauseam for nearly 15 years, with many cases involving personal sacrifice (justified or not).   Debating on the merits is fine, but having ot go back to first principles every 5 years for a new generation means we are just spinning our wheels.   That's why there often is appeal to history or authority.   i.e. "Read the mailing lists, they're archived", etc.   That's not a great situation, I admit.   But most new technologies have traditionally had a "vendor engine" behind them pushing marketing, training, books, etc. to perpetuate the meme.   That seems to be less common with the open source / internet vendor world, or maybe it's just that REST is still too new and misunderstood.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3540193&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%74%70%74%61%63%65%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=320></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3540369 href="vote?for=3540369&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%74%70%74%61%63%65%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3540369></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 3 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3540369">link</a></span></div><br>

I think it's reasonable to see REST as the underlying style of the web, and the web has some very beneficial properties (scalability, evolvability) which therefore stand to REST's merit.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3539721&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%74%70%74%61%63%65%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3539752 href="vote?for=3539752&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%74%70%74%61%63%65%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3539752></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3539752">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#5a5a5a>Actually, we ding you for putting sensitive information in URLs that are used in a browser.  The reason is that it will then be sent to other sites in the referrer header.  When it is used for an API it doesn't matter.  A security audit will check that logs are not logging sensitive information or that they are properly secured and encrypted if they do contain such information.  The combination of telling users to put their password into the url and logging the url would be a problem, but not either thing on its own.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3539315&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%74%70%74%61%63%65%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3539354 href="vote?for=3539354&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%74%70%74%61%63%65%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3539354></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3539354">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>No, SomeOtherGuy. This is an HTTPS site. The referer header does not behave the way you're implying it does on HTTPS sites.<p>And having read and written this particular audit line item about 29074894389734897 times in the last 15 years, let me assure you that logging is clearly an issue.<p>The bit about how "if someone can see your logs you're already boned" is also message-board-logic more than reality. Logs are shipped all over the place. On a network pentest, one of the things you do when you pop a box is hunt for logs; even after you get root on the machine, you don't automatically have all the passwords that get stuck in the log files. Same goes for all the random LogLogic-style consoles those logs get fed to.<p>If you have more questions about this stuff, my contact info is in my profile --- just click my username above this comment.
