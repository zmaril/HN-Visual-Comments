My impression was that big companies especially are set up to pay contractors either by the hour or per-project, and don't really like alternative arrangements. The (admittedly few) people I know who try to bill by the day or week still convert it to an hourly rate for invoicing; they might verbally agree with the client on something taking "one week", but they submit an invoice for 40 hours to the client's payroll department, because those are the kinds of invoices they know how to pay.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3420754 href="vote?for=3420754&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%62%59%49%4f%73%64%65%30%49%38"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3420754></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 32 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3420754">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It might just be a bit of software-pleasing dance, but (this is secondhand information, fwiw) the usual practice for doing "weekly" work seems to be to just agree on an hourly rate and then agree that you're going to bill them 40 hours for "one week of full-time work". So saying "I'm going to work on this full-time for the next 3 weeks" translates in invoice-speak to "I'm going to send an invoice for 120 hours of work at $agreed_rate", treating "40 hours" and "1 week" as just alternate units for the same quantity, rather than sending a detailed statement that you spent 2.5 hours on Task A and 4.5 on Task B. So I guess it's effectively weekly billing in a roundabout way. (This is mostly Lockheed-type companies that I hear about, which seem to treat single-person consultants as effectively "outside employees", and only like to negotiate custom terms with giant consulting firms like KBR.)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3422214 href="vote?for=3422214&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%62%59%49%4f%73%64%65%30%49%38"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3422214></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=gnosis">gnosis</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3422214">link</a></span></div><br>

My hourly would have to be 8x my daily, my 4-hourly 2x my daily, &#38;c"</i><p>If they are paying at least your daily rate, why would you mind that your day is shot for your other clients?  They are, effectively, hiring you for the entire day and paying what you've determined you deserve for it.<p>If they are inattentive/crazy enough to actually pay you more than your daily rate for an hour (or any number of hours up to the maximum number of hours you'd work in a day anyway), then that's just pure gravy.  Same for the case when it takes you less than a day to do the work you're getting paid at least your daily rate for.<p>In your original post, you'd said <i>"I can't effectively work for any other client that day, so my minimum billable increment is a person-day"</i> so in recommending the raising of your hourly rate to more than your daily rate, I was going on the assumption that your daily rate would have been sufficient for you to accept the job in the first place.<p>Of course, if you can't afford to work a day for your new client because of other commitments, you'll either have to refuse the job or raise your rate to the point that it is worthwhile for you after all.

Perhaps it is because I usually only work for very technically saavy customers, but I find that I learn a lot from my customers and the work that I do.<p>I was in a situation all last year were I was working over 25 hours a week for a childhood friend's company and although both he and some of his co-workers were wizards, there was a large opportunity cost of not being able to do much work for my other customers.<p>Since I work remotely and thereby compete with offshore talent I don't charge much for my time ($60/hour) so the experience that I get has a fractionally large value.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Hi, Mark.  Yes, I definitely remember you!<p>I'm still (yes, still...) working on my PhD, but I'm consulting full time nowadays, and have been for a while.<p>I do tend to work far too many hours, but it's mostly because I'm enjoying what I'm doing, and am learning as much as I'm doing for clients.  That said, I feel very fortunate that I spent a lot of time with my children, and that I have the flexibility to help my wife out and work on other things (e.g., the PhD) along with paying the mortgage and such.  We've taken a 10-day family vacation to Europe for the last two summers, as well; travel can indeed be addictive!<p>I don't think that there's a tension between maximizing profit and family/friends.  On the contrary, one of the reasons why I'm interested in the discussion here is that I'd like to make more during the hours that I do consult, so that I can work fewer hours and have more time to work on personal projects, sleep (!), and family, not necessarily in that order.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3420779 href="vote?for=3420779&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%62%59%49%4f%73%64%65%30%49%38"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3420779></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ErikRogneby">ErikRogneby</a> 32 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3420779">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I do raise my rates about once a year. I do mostly AI and text mining, and there is a lot of excellent offshore talent that I am competing with (judging from the people who I sometimes team with). All in all, getting $60/hour working remotely (I live in the mountains in Arizona, a low population area and fairly inexpensive cost of living) is about right. I get about double that rate when I travel and work onsite for US customers, but I prefer to not do that because it interferes with regular life. I also turn down over 80% of consulting offers because I usually prefer spending my time writing (I am also an author) or working on my own projects.

Fortunately, in almost all cases, my clients learn that they can trust me to be aligned with their business interests, and that I'd rather help them to succeed than find new ways to charge them without working.

Maybe I'm subconsciously doing things slowly, or not using the best techniques I can, but I do think that I try to do the best and fastest job that I can.  My interest is in pleasing clients and doing new and interesting things.

It sounds like I estimate a project as taking two weeks (i.e., 10 days).  One week into the project, it looks like it'll take one more week than I originally expected (i.e., a total of three weeks).  So I tell the client that it'll now cost them for three weeks of my time.  Did I understand you right?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This isn't complicated.<p>You do a proposal for a client. You give an honest conservative estimate of how much time it's going to take.<p>Say it's a Rails CRUD app with no special domain code. Ok, 2 weeks, broken out into 2 billable weeks. The proposal says something like:<p><pre><code>   Week 1: 5 person/days, $5,000 (Setup, Discovery, Backend)
   Week 2: 5 person/days, $5,000 (Front-end, testing, delivery)
   TOTAL PRICE: $10,000
</code></pre>
Accompanying your proposal is a SOW that says something to the effect of:<p><i>This project will be billed on a time/materials basis, starting Monday January 23rd and continuing for 10 contiguous business days through February 3rd. If additional time is required to complete this project, it will be billed at a rate of $1,000 per person day, provided that notice is provided within 1 week of February 3rd</i>.<p>Presto, a proposal for a project that costs $10,000 billed time/materials at $1k/day (again, lowball figs).<p>Now, 2 weeks to complete this project is conservative. Also built into every proposal, whether you like it or not, is the collection of moments in every working day where you are not productive. So ask yourself, if I took 100 provigils† and eliminated ALL NON PRODUCTIVE TIME from my schedule for the entire next 2 weeks and completed this project in 7 days instead of 10, who should get that $3,000 of value I just generated?<p>The answer to that question is "you".<p>You don't generally want to rig your contracts so that they are padded out with unproductive time the client pays for; that's called "rustproofing" and it's bad business. But at the same time, clients actually value determinism more than they value any single billable day. If the client accepts a project for $10,000, they are going to be way more irritated if the project takes 15 days to finish than they are if you finish in 9 days instead of 10.<p>You have knobs to turn here too. Say you finish in 9 days instead of 10 because you drug yourself into working 18 hour days. Keep the $1,000. Say instead you finish in 5 days instead of 10 because the project turns out to be way simpler than you expected. Well, in that case, give the client their $5,000 billable week back. Think of this in terms of a minimum billable increment, where you don't credit partial weeks --- if you had to work at all in that week, that week is shot for other clients --- but will credit full weeks.<p>You see now how it's maybe not in your best interests to have your minimum billable increment be "one hour"?<p>† <i>Please don't do drugs.</i></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3421946 href="vote?for=3421946&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%62%59%49%4f%73%64%65%30%49%38"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3421946></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=reuven">reuven</a> 31 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3421946">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>OK, I gotta say that after many years of consulting, this is the first truly new, clever billing technique that I've seen.  Better yet, it's a win for all sides.<p>This comes closer to per-project pricing from the client's perspective, which they prefer because they want to know how much they're paying.  (As you put it, "deterministic pricing.")<p>I tend to time-slice my weeks, so I don't think that it would work for me.  But it might well work for the people who work for me, who do tend to work complete weeks on projects.<p>I do have to wonder how Israeli companies would react to this sort of thing.  My guess is that they'll do the math, and then complain about the high hourly rate.<p>But the only way to find out is to try, and you've definitely inspired me to give this system a whirl.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>But why do you assume that I am "setting myself up to get paid way less"? As I said, I have no evidence to suggest that I would command a significantly higher rate on a daily or weekly basis than I do now.

I guess I just don't see why going as far as daily/weekly billing doesn't net a significant part of the downside (no hard limit on hours vs. compensation, no clear cut-off where clients have no claim on any work I do other than for their project) without necessarily netting much upside.<p>As I said,  perhaps that's the way the game happens to be played in whatever markets you've been working in.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I couldn't experiment with his advice with my current business model. Working on a longer time interval (daily, weekly) when you want to deal with multiple clients during a single interval is a recipe for unhappy clients and potentially legal fees.<p>If I am billing weekly, but in practice I do 2.5 days of work for each of two clients, do I bill both for the entire week? Most of Thomas's arguments for rounding up in these longer increments on the basis of opportunity cost demonstrably don't apply in this context, because clearly I <i>can</i> use the other time to work for another client. The <i>best</i> outcome I see if someone I'm working for finds out is that I have an unhappy client and probably lose the contract -- which is fair enough, frankly, if I'm billing for a week but only actually working for them for half of that time.<p>For the avoidance of doubt, I'm not arguing against having a reasonable minimum billing period so clients don't mess you around and so you can manage your time sensibly. I'm just challenging the notion that "hourly" is not a reasonable period for some of us, and pointing out that "daily" or "weekly" can have serious drawbacks too.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3420689 href="vote?for=3420689&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%62%59%49%4f%73%64%65%30%49%38"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3420689></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dirtyaura">dirtyaura</a> 32 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3420689">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I've raised my rates in the past, and it has both helped business and improved the quality of my clients, no doubt.<p>But in Israel, I've found that anything over $100/hour scares off everyone, including the very largest potential clients.  They're used to paying $60/hour for top brass at a consulting firm, which makes it difficult to convince them that my higher rates are worthwhile.<p>I'm not saying that convincing them is impossible; I've made a living in this way for 15 years now, helped in part by my willingness to negotiate and discount my rates in exchange for long-term agreements.  But whereas the US and Europe might have large, wealthy companies with technical needs who don't flinch at $150/hour or even $200/hour, such rates would get you tossed out on your ear in Israel.<p>That said, I haven't tried charging by the day, and will give it a shot at the next opportunity.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>If the clients you're dealing with are scared by person/day rates, stop working with them</i><p>I agree, there are no other industries where a professional will take on the business risk of another party with the exception of legal, and when they do they expect 30% of the case winnings. But for the vast majority of legal they charge for every hour worked. There is no reason for freelancers to work on a project compensation basis, they are shouldering unnecessary risk, that is usually due to the client not understanding development. Per project pricing immediately sets the freelancer up to have to defend against every change that inevitably comes in. Unless it is routine work, I rarely take on custom development work as anything other than an hourly arrangement.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3421320 href="vote?for=3421320&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%62%59%49%4f%73%64%65%30%49%38"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3421320></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 32 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3421320">link</a></span></div><br>

I was just adding cometary to the discussion and not trying to refute a position, I apologize if my wording did not convey that. what I was trying to say was if a person is scared of by a day rate, because they want a total rate then I tend to shy away from those projects. I will provide an estimate of what I think it will take, but there is an understanding that due to the nature of software development that estimate will change the first time they change their mind.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I've found with small customers to begin with a small, fixed price project.  Show them the world and experience of their dreams.<p>Working with smaller customers does often mean a more limited budget so you can help them focus on getting the best bang for the buck.  Help the customer grow and they'll have more money to spend with you.<p>The thing you can do with small businesses is pick the winning horses and bet on them.  Find the owners that 'get it' while small and help them grow.  This might be 1 in every 7-15 customers.<p>I have a customer I did at $5K project for a complete workflow management.  It was a favor to a ex-vp of a company who had opened up his own business.  Originally they wanted me to fix PHP bugs for that much but I just rewrote the thing in a few weeks.  At the end I realized it was easily 3 or 4 times the cost and I made sure they knew this was it.  I resumed my normal billing rate (they had no problems with it) after a problemless launch.  They had been trying to build the same system for almost 2 years with someone else and were pretty happy.<p>4 years later they don't have a budget for me: as in, they spend whatever they want because they've at least added 20,000 sales/customers to their system.  While this didn't happen because of my software alone, (they had an excellent manual paper system), helping automate their systemization sure helped them take off.<p>Do this kind of work not as your primary but maybe 20-30% of your time.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>A product is "viable" if it generates enough value for a group of customers that they find it worth paying for.<p>The "minimum viable" product is the product that does the minimum set of things to be viable.<p>Viability and quality are usually orthogonal concerns. Viability and <i>polish</i> are especially likely to be orthogonal.<p>There are markets you can serve in which polish matters a great deal.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Except that isn't what it is. MVP is a term taken directly from Lean Startup, in which Eric even includes concepts like the Dropbox "Video MVP" (<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/19/dropbox-minimal-viable-product/" rel="nofollow">http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/19/dropbox-minimal-viable-prod...</a>) which arguably isn't actually a product and more importantly no one was paying them for it.<p>The problem with MVP is people assume it's about how the adjectives "minimum" and "viable" apply to the noun "product" which is too a view (but one I had myself before actually reading TLS).  The reality is it is just a placeholder for the process of lean validated learning.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3417488 href="vote?for=3417488&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%62%59%49%4f%73%64%65%30%49%38"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3417488></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=morsch">morsch</a> 33 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3417488">link</a></span></div><br>
