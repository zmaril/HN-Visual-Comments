<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This is probably true for dental, for a lot of reasons, including the routinization of dental care, the degree to which dental expenses are preventable, the fact that fewer people have dental insurance than health insurance (and so the market for dental care is less distorted), and the extent to which dental care can be cosmetic.<p>The same isn't true of health care. The health care market is totally distorted by insurers, who collude with providers to set prices. Services fall into two buckets: routine "checkup" type stuff that costs so little it's not worth arguing about, and hospital/specialist services for which there is no pricing transparency and which, purchased by anyone other than an insurance company, is catastrophically expensive.<p>It is perfectly reasonable to advocate for single-payer health care even if one believes firmly in moral hazard. There are other interventions one could advocate for instead. But any way you slice it, the "market" we currently have is busted.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3531528&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3531712 href="vote?for=3531712&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3531712></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=_delirium">_delirium</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3531712">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Health also has significant variance in outcomes, much more than the variance in dental costs, so it makes sense to pool risk. However, the fact that events aren't uncorrelated like a lightning strike makes it hard to deal with as an "insurance", the usual risk-pooling strategy, because in many cases the event has already happened, so no sane insurer would insure against it (how is it insurance if it has an 100% chance of occurring?).<p>For example, an American friend of mine has a congenital heart defect which will over his lifetime cost probably $1m or so; I had better luck and was not born with one. It seems sort of problematic imo that this sort of thing isn't risk-pooled across the population. It's already bad enough that he has to have surgeries/etc. for it, but due to our health system it <i>also</i> impacts areas of his life that shouldn't be affected, like choice of career. For example, he can never start a startup or do freelance/consulting work, because he wouldn't be able to buy individual health insurance; so he <i>has</i> to work at a large company with a good group-health plan, and can never be unemployed for longer than the 18-month COBRA limit.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3531712&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=14></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"></span></div><span class="comment">[deleted]</span></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3531748 href="vote?for=3531748&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3531748></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=_delirium">_delirium</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3531748">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Sure, people can't be the same, but I see paying for major healthcare problems as just one of the basic "civilized society" baselines. I mean, in most of those other cases you have other choices: can't be an air force pilot, do something else. And we do make some baseline effort to ensure that you have <i>some</i> ability to choose a career, by providing free public education. But if you have a heart that doesn't work without medical treatment, you don't have an alternative to "get medical treatment".<p>I guess I don't at all mind paying an equal share of those kinds of expenses, either. To me, not having heart defects, leukemia, down syndrome, or any of a number of things I might've had is its own reward, because my quality of life is better and I don't have to get surgeries and whatnot. I don't see a need to <i>also</i> come out financially ahead of those who had the misfortune to need the surgeries, so I win the health lottery twice and they lose it twice.<p>The moral-hazard problem also seems pretty weak, at least when it comes to major things like surgeries; I doubt there are many people who would've avoided getting cancer if they had to pay for it, but if it was free decided hey what the heck (that is, the suckiness of major illnesses is already a bigger disincentive than the expense of treatment). Moral hazard might come into it more with things like overprescription of antibiotics for routine/minor illnesses.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3531748&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3531763 href="vote?for=3531763&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3531763></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sliverstorm">sliverstorm</a> 4 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3531763">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#9c9c9c>There was single payer before the tax code subsidy for insurance came along.  It was called "cash".<p>The subsidy is responsible for a lot of distortion.  It has separated cost and benefit in the minds of employees.<p>And it hands more of a subsidy to people who make more money.  Taking insurance from your employer is a bad deal if you don't make enough.  Which is why many employers of lower paying jobs don't offer it.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3531630&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3530794 href="vote?for=3530794&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3530794></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3530794">link</a> | <a href="item?id=3530247">parent</a> | on: <a href="item?id=3528505">Five Days in the Valley: An East Coaster's Take on...</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>But lottery returns might be better than startup returns. In both cases, investor sentiment is hyper-focused on the very, very low probability event of a high return, but unlike startups, the lottery's returns are deliberately smoothed to keep people playing.<p>That doesn't make lotto better than startups; the lotto is obviously objectively much worse. But the financial outcome of an unsophisticated investment in startups is likely to be worse than a lottery ticket; if you buy a bunch of lottery tickets, you'll get something back. If you don't know the industry, investing in startups is like throwing your money away.<p>I think something people don't consider in these discussions is that the current startup ecosystem --- the one in which the majority of companies return zero to their investors! ---  is the product of relatively sophisticated investment. It's not impossible for a huckster to get funded, but it's troublesome enough that truly fraudulent companies are the exception.<p>All that changes once you set up a structure that allows people to "fund" companies "retail".</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3530003&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3530695 href="vote?for=3530695&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3530695></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=gojomo">gojomo</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3530695">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There are already plenty of legal ways for people to "throw away" 100% of their money, as quickly as they'd like. It is only their own judgement, perhaps after being burnt or perhaps after watching others get burnt, that keeps these processes in check.<p>You're overestimating the effective payback of lotteries, for example. If someone "invests" $1000 in government scratchers, perhaps they'll technically get around $300 back on an expected-return basis. But they were playing to win, so that $300 is used to buy more scratchers. Lather, rinse, repeat: they're at zero. Within a day. Legally.<p>The only lesson to be learned there is: the government shouldn't offer, and the public shouldn't buy, rigged games.<p>Even the worst hopelessly-naive startup dream or haphazardly-structured equity investment offers a greater benefit to the participants and society, even when there's a 100% loss.<p>Someone was being paid a salary and devoting effort to a purpose as they burnt through the money. They'll do better next time.<p>The investors, too, will either drop out or better evaluate/structure the risks (and their tolerance for risk) the next time. People of all means (not just SEC-accredited millionaires) know to get started at something slowly, in measured amounts. That means the learning losses are effectively capped, while the social benefits coming from those who do manage to learn could grow very large.<p>And if everyone with less than a million dollars is so clumsy with money they can't possibly learn, we shouldn't let them buy stock/options, leveraged real estate, or lottery tickets, either.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3530695&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3530762 href="vote?for=3530762&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3530762></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3530762">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Startups <i>are</i> worthwhile even when they fail. They are practice within an operating domain where <i>learning over time happens</i>, and <i>positive-sum outcomes are possible</i>, and <i>individuals' incentives towards improvement create social benefits</i>.<p>On the other hand, there is no chance that tomorrow, with more experience, someone will be a better lottery-ticket-buyer than today. The activity throws off no lessons for those involved or outside observers about what technologies or partnerships or businesses might work in the future. And yet that gambling is legal and easy for people of any net worth, while non-millionaires face legal deterrents for startup investing.<p>I didn't suggest 'encouraging people to burn money' on startups. There's no talk of creating subsidies or tax-advantages over other investments. Every check-writer needs to make their own calculation about the returns they expect, and the losses they can handle.<p>But it's their own damn money! How about we just remove the ancient, patronizing net-worth discrimination that makes it harder for non-millionaries to engage in private investing than other activities just as risky and more destructive?<p>It'd be a win for society to let 'normal people' of all wealth levels practice their competencies in a non-rigged, learnable, positive-sum business domain. When you say, "If you don't know the industry, investing in startups is like throwing your money away", that's not a bug, that's a feature. The losses would start the learning, and participants would improve or select-out very quickly. And the overall economy progresses in exactly that way: needing many small investigational failures to train the young, explore the possibility space, and lay the foundation for later big successes.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3532128&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3526546 href="vote?for=3526546&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3526546></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 6 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3526546">link</a> | <a href="item?id=3526542">parent</a> | on: <a href="item?id=3526277">FTP Must Die</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Only tftp is widely supported by embedded ROMs, for netboot or for loading a new firmware for embedded devices with broken OS images.<p>It's not a matter of getting TCP running.  You'd need a basic http transfer client, too.  Not many network bootloaders or firmware loaders support anything other than tftp.<p>iPXE supports http.  Get iPXE into embedded bootloaders for new firmware loading, and into network device ROMs for network booting, and then people can switch.  Until then, it's tftp because that's what everyone supports.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3528469&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3527312 href="vote?for=3527312&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%48%41%49%4e%75%63%51%43%75%34"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3527312></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=yuhong">yuhong</a> 5 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3527312">link</a></span></div><br>
