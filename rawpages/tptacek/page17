<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This is such a great thread.<p>I've been hoping to see something tangible from VJ on this for awhile now. He was doing content-based networking even back when he was at Cisco.<p>To an extent I think recognized by a lot of networking researchers, including IIRC YC's Robert Morris at MIT, the future of the Internet is probably not IPv6 and a network consisting of operating systems addressed by scalar integers.<p>Instead, IP-type protocols are going to assume the same role that Ethernet and 802.11 (and ATM) play today, as a substrate for connectivity on top of which real applications will be built. The wide area discovery and "session" (OSI style) management roles played by IP and TCP will be played by overlay networks. We have primitive overlays now (DHTs, BitTorrent, Skype) and proprietary ones (CDNs like Akamai, whatever the cable content providers are using to push VOD to the edge), but eventually we'll get a general-purpose open one and the game will be on.<p>I think this follows straightforwardly from Reed's end-to-end argument. Intelligence belongs to the edges, not the core of the network; intelligence at the core is necessarily a lowest-common-denominator affair, and is hard to scale. That's a key reason why we don't have multicast today. Routers are so bad at scale that tier 1 NSPs filtered BGP announcements by prefix length, because they couldn't handle /32-granular routing for even the tiny subset of machines that actually wanted it (begging the question of how we ever expect IPv6 to do the things the typical HN reader hopes they'll do, like provide them with their own portable /16-equivalents). Multicast effectively asked those same overtaxed routers to address <i>web pages</i>, <i>individually</i>.<p>That's obviously not going to work when the service model involves random people demanding that AT&#38;T and Level3 add routing table entries for their podcasts. But it scales just fine when the thousands of machines interested in those podcasts share a protocol and an infrastructure for arranging a fan-out overlay.<p>So many unsolved problems here, from "what is the most reasonable kernel of overlay assembly, group management, and routing to deploy to end-systems" to "how do we avoid congestion collapse in arbitrary group messaging protocols" (a study of multicast reliability algorithms --- at least, from the late 90s when I last did this stuff --- will probably horrify you). But the great thing about it is, nobody has to ask permission to make this stuff work; we can evolve to the <i>real</i> next Internet without getting Comcast's permission, or for that matter (more perniciously) the IETF's.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3408600 href="vote?for=3408600&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%59%71%34%61%78%62%78%70%72%64"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3408600></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Locke1689">Locke1689</a> 36 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3408600">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Yes, there are a huge number of advances to be made in this area. IP multicast was certainly the first draft in making this kind of networking possible but the fundamental problem is the incompatibility with the rest of the way the Internet is run.<p>The problem we were trying to address in the graduate class is that Jacobson's paper simply assumes that the Internet suddenly "switches," like a lightbulb, to this new method of routing. I think everyone agrees that something that looks like CCN will become the future, but we were interested in the road to get there. We were trying to examine the problems associated with porting to this kind of network without preexisting infrastructure in place.<p>One thing that you may find interesting is that the network tends to look more like a very layered Bittorrent network in current IP infrastructure, so it may end up that the most effective research ground for an intermediate protocol would be in adapting Bittorrent. The second area that I think is really interesting is secure and (perhaps more importantly) authenticated communication in this protocol. There's an entire other paper cited at the bottom of the CCN paper that I linked to that details the cryptographic authentication used in CCN but there are a number of things that I think either need more detail to be worked through or put me on the edge a little.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3408645 href="vote?for=3408645&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%59%71%34%61%78%62%78%70%72%64"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3408645></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 36 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3408645">link</a></span></div><br>

Before BitTorrent, when FEC-based multicast file transfer was either FLID/DL (an IETF standard that never went anywhere) or the startup by the guy who invented Tornado codes.<p>We had a centralized tree-structured directory for discovery, and then (at first) deployable nodes running group messaging and running a weighted link-state routing protocol (more or less cribbed from OSPF), then later a small kernel message forwarding scheme with a programmable control plane so we could build arbitrary routing protocols in Tcl.<p>Our initial application was chat (we overengineered, like, a little) and we pivoted to streaming video.<p>We died in part because we hadn't the slightest clue what we were doing, and in part because the VCs replaced our management with a team that decided our best bet was to take our superior technology and go head-to-head with Akamai with our own streaming video CDN.<p>We'd have been better off just open-sourcing.<p>Anyhow: I'm obviously biased, but the way I think this is going to happen is, some open source project to build arbitrary overlays is going to catch on (the overlay will be a means-to-an-end for some killer app people actually care about; my bet is, telepresence).</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3410662 href="vote?for=3410662&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%59%71%34%61%78%62%78%70%72%64"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3410662></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Locke1689">Locke1689</a> 35 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3410662">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Very interesting. The main difference in our work is that we really latched on to VJ's idea of breadcrumbs and caching blocks. When I alluded to Bittorrent I wasn't really referring to FEC-based distribution. The problem with FEC is as you said somewhere else -- it's not very efficient for small files and it currently isn't very location aware (aside from Ono, my professor's research lab's Bittorrent plugin) so you can end up going halfway around the world for relevant pieces of the file.<p>Instead, we were more interested with the robust swarm implementations that were already present in some Bittorrent clients, like fairly efficient DHTs. It is also an already existing protocol with millions of users so we could piggyback on Bittorrent clients with plugins to measure the real performance all over the world.<p>The key difference is the caching. Jacobson proposes that the caching would happen in the ISPs, but there's no reason peers couldn't take up the slack, only different monetary incentives. The protocol here becomes less like OSPF and more like distributed k-minimum spanning tree. If you can find the "supernodes" then you can implement caching on their front and prevent unnecessary communication.<p>Of course, if you think anything like me your first thought is, "do we actually know if data requests are reliably concentrated in a specific area such that local caching will actually provide much of a benefit?" My partners thought the same thing, which is why they ended up doing a Bittorrent traffic analysis to attempt to plot an AS distribution curve for data requests[1]. They found that there was huge redundancy in intra-AS requests, so there's at least potential here.<p>Of course there are still a number of problems to be worked out -- if the supernodes don't have an easy incentive to provide caching to other people in their AS, how do we develop such an incentive? But the overall protocol seems very interesting. Most notably it would <i>not</i> work like FEC and small files would probably benefit even more from the caching (which is why you'll also note that files are split into blocks or datagrams or whatever you wish to call them in the VJ protocol).<p>[1] <a href="http://acm.eecs.northwestern.edu/site_media/cccp.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://acm.eecs.northwestern.edu/site_media/cccp.pdf</a><p>I really don't deserve to be on this paper -- Zach and John really ran this show.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3409118 href="vote?for=3409118&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%59%71%34%61%78%62%78%70%72%64"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3409118></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jamii">jamii</a> 36 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3409118">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Yes. Simplified: you take a message and break it into <i>n</i> blocks such that any unique subset of <i>k</i> many of those blocks reconstitutes the message, even those <i>k</i> is less than <i>n</i>.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Yes, that blog post by Jim is what led me to investigate and write about this.<p>The Stefan Savage paper you refer to wasn't so much about ignoring congestion signals as deliberately faking reception of data that hadn't actually been received. With things like duplicate acks or optimistic acking, you could cause the sender to open their window size to whatever you want.<p><a href="http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~savage/papers/CCR99.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~savage/papers/CCR99.pdf</a><p>Back in 1999, I was working on integrating these ideas into a router product. It would be software in your home gateway that would keep a cache of the last observed window size for each pair of hosts for a few seconds.<p>If you started another TCP connection to the same host within that short interval, the router would spoof both sides to increase the window size to the previous value / 2 and then let additive increase take over from there. This bypasses slow start but the current available bandwidth is likely to be very close to the estimate within that short range and hosts didn't cache window size, even when making multiple connections in a short period (e.g., HTTP 1.0)<p>I archived this paper and a bunch more here.

He can reasonably expect to care: it's his photo attached to his personal profile and his photo is part of how he chooses to portray himself online. Siegler now knows that he cannot be himself on Google+, and now thousands of others know that they cannot be themselves on Google+ either.<p>The question is: why does Google care so much that about the minutae of how individuals choose to portray themselves while they face much greater problems related to the success or otherwise of their new social network?<p>Putting aside the spam problems that render Google+ at best noisy and at worse useless, if Google is so intolerant that it silently censors a hand gesture considered impolite in where their HQ is based, how else will they behave? Will they censor every gesture that might be considered offensive somewhere in the world (there are many)?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There are public sections of G+ and private sections.  If you have a private album limited to 4chan buddies or whatever with tubgirl, goatse, the lemon party, etc. and they took that down, I would find issue with it.  But if you've got goatse as your public profile picture, that is an issue that Google has to deal with.  I use those examples not because they are directly comparable to what Siegler put up, but because I imagine most of the people here on hn would find those images offensive.<p>When you're dealing with a really massive user base, you're inevitably going to have a lot of people that would find an image of a guy flipping the bird to be horribly offensive (their heads would simply explode if they ever saw goatse). Should you cater to those people? Where do you draw the line? Do you go with the U.S. Supreme Court's definition of obscenity? Siegler's picture is certainly not obscene, but it would certainly make a prude think twice about signing up for G+. I would rather not cater to the prudes of the world, but if Google wants every person with access to the internet on G+, then they'll have to offer some concessions to them.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3405901 href="vote?for=3405901&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%59%71%34%61%78%62%78%70%72%64"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3405901></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=redcap">redcap</a> 37 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3405901">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>My point is that it's all relative, and from Google's perspective, something bad will happen--people won't use their service. Telling your potential users to grow up and act like reasonable people is not going to be a successful strategy when your goal is getting literally everyone with an internet connection to use your service. Lots of people are not rational, reasonable or mature. Personally, I don't find dicks and gore to be disgusting. It's just absurd to me. Of course, I understand perfectly well that other people find it disgusting, just as I can understand that there are a lot of people in the U.S. that find the middle finger to be objectionable (hey, maybe they aren't even offended by it, maybe they just don't want to explain what that gesture means to their kid, who then runs around flipping off everyone at their school [true story, I did that when I was about 4 years old]).<p>Almost any business that is targeted at a mass audience understands this and governs their products accordingly. If you find their censorship to be prudish and ridiculous, you can boycott them and use the Fuck You Network. I suppose if enough people boycott G+ for being unreasonably prudish, maybe they'll change their position, but judging by past performance, it seems like the prudes win these fights. Social networks are not like content distributors like HBO, that can appeal to a relatively small niche and be successful, for G+ it's all or nothing.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3406906 href="vote?for=3406906&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%59%71%34%61%78%62%78%70%72%64"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3406906></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ThaddeusQuay2">ThaddeusQuay2</a> 36 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3406906">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The <i>adult</i> thing is to not be a child who thinks flipping the bird in his profile is something to be proud of. Siegler's little renegade act probably wouldn't work so well with the people who still think you can be a badass <i>tech writer</i> if he refrained, though.<p>MC Siegler and his fans are completely and totally allowed to share pictures of them fingering at each other (that came out wrong, but I'm leaving it for posterity) in private circles on G+, aren't they? But Google doesn't want it in people's public feeds.<p>I don't find it offensive--I do find it stupid in that sort of "oh, look at the Internet Tough Guy" way, but that's a far cry from taking offense--but at the same time I can entirely get why Google wouldn't be all happy and such with that sort of picture in folks' public feeds. Like it or not, there are some venues where you get to be a little civilized if you want to be out in public, and Google's decided that they have a bit of a dress code in their neck of the woods: shirt optional, pants optional, tie not required, birds <i>verboten</i>. Not a big deal; the total of this tragedy is pretty much that MC Siegler will have to resort to other methods than a bird in a profile picture to show what a trendy rebel with his fingers on the pulse of Technoeverything he really is.<p>Maybe he could do it with a thoughtful, well-written, incisive arti...ahahahahaha.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think Tom is right that MySpace lost out to facebook because it is underpoliced.  It became the cesspool of the internet.  Policing can take many forms, for instance, Facebook doesn't allow people to add a lot of "bling" to their profiles as MySpace does/did.  Reddit and Slashdot crowdsource their policing, by having a rating/karma system that discourages people from posting stuff that is bothersome to others.  There are all kinds of things that can be done.<p>But just letting anyone do anything is not a good approach.  The small minority who will get up in arms about such a thing is nothing compared to the masses that will leave when they decide that the anything goes approach has allowed G+ to become a cesspool like MySpace.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3407306 href="vote?for=3407306&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%59%71%34%61%78%62%78%70%72%64"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3407306></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=RexRollman">RexRollman</a> 36 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3407306">link</a></span></div><br>

While a middle finger may not be particularly offensive to most people (including me), more people are likely to be offended by it than are likely to get their knickers in a twist over such a photo being removed. Ergo, it gets removed.<p>Waste time with warnings about offensive content and blah-blah-derpa-blah? No. Your potentially-offensive content can be kept in private circles and you can exercise good judgement about what you make public. <i>That</i> is the better solution. (And just in case--save the "well, what <i>is</i> offensive, how do we know?" silliness.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's not at all a reductionist straw-man argument.  The post I responded to argued that if more than one person flagged the post as offensive that the content should be removed.  The argument assumed that there should/could be a vote on if something is offensive, and if more people found it offensive it should be removed.<p>That line of reasoning is flawed, especially since there's no way to vote that you're not offended (other than the original person posting).  That's an absurd system, where only the offended can voice their opinion.  Even if those not offended could vote, who would vote on everything they're not offended by.  That's still silly.  Any system that attempts to allow people to vote/flag offensive material is inherently flawed.<p>That leaves us (or really Google) with an arbitrary decision on what should be allowed and what should be banned.  Asking me (or anyone else) to save the "well, what is offensive" argument is silly.  That's the WHOLE point.  It's an arbitrary decision, one we all might come to different conclusions on.  That underlines my point, that it's an arbitrary decision, and one that's been made for no good reason, given a system where you don't have to follow MG on Google+.  There's a natural option (and given your obvious attitude on Mr. Siegler, the one you'll likely take), just don't follow him or look at his Google+ page.  There's no reason to remove the content, and Google should be called out for it.  MG might have over-reacted, and might be worthy of being called out too.  I'm only calling out the system of "voting" to determine what's offensive.  That's just a silly system.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3408889 href="vote?for=3408889&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%59%71%34%61%78%62%78%70%72%64"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3408889></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=eropple">eropple</a> 36 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3408889">link</a></span></div><br>
