<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Defenders of the Post Office like to say this, but it is at odds with reality.<p>The prefunding requirement only requires them to have the NPV value of future payments for everyone who currently or formerly works for them.  This is how everyone <i>should</i> accumulate pensions: the alternative is an accounting gimmick in which you promise unsustainable future payments today and then make yourself scarce (or ask for the taxpayer to clean up your mess) when they come due tomorrow.<p>(The minimum requirement for all employers is that they implement pay-as-you-go, which means that someone's pension should be fully funded at the point where they start drawing benefits.  This means that, if you hypothetically have 100k employees who are 5 years from retirement, you can report a pension fund with no assets as fully funded today.  This gives you five years to look under the seat cushions for the $25 billion you need to come up with to avoid insolvency.  Congress has decided to not let the Post Office implement pay-as-you-go because Congress anticipates that the Post Office will, if allowed to do that, report "The Post Office is profitable on its own revenues and receives no support from the federal government" reliably every year until their pension fund implodes with a 13 figure uncovered liability.)<p>They're separately required to produce accounting projections for the next 75 years, but those don't have a funding mandate attached to them.<p><a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/CNBC/Sections/News_And_Analysis/_Blogs/NetNet/__DAILY_POSTS/CRSmemo_postal_rhb.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/CNBC/Sections/News_And_Analysis/...</a><p>The part most relevant to the discussion is the paragraphs surrounding: "Under current law, PAEA (P.L.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You have quite a bit of latitude in how high ceremony your expense tracking needs to be, though.  "CC hotel / travel expenses to our standard address, put everything on the company card" is likely adequate, as long as there's a contemporaneous record of business travel.  Many places keep that as a formal log book, but since the IRS is pretty much ambivalent about the exact form of your records as long as they capture the important stuff, a Google Calendar entry with "Bob speaking at $FOO_CONF in Boston 3/14" probably suffices.  In the event of an audit, you'll be asked to provide supporting documentation (again, wide latitude) of a small sampling of those expenses, because they have no more desire to read five thousand pages of records than you do to write them.  If you're unable to provide those records, but don't strike the examiner as actively malicious, they'll say "Alright, there's two ways I can do this.  My book says we think you have about $X of legit deductions for this category, which is $Y less than you're claiming.  Pay $Y plus our below market interest rate for making an honest mistake.  Otherwise, you and I get to do things line by line, and I'm going to suddenly get <i>very</i> picky.  Which would you prefer?"<p>There's also a certain element of "In the vanishingly unlikely event the IRS audited us, disallowed <i>every</i> expense our employees charged in the year, and then charged taxes on those plus the standard penalty interest, that wouldn't cost us enough for us to even notice it."</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3504929&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%69%65%6e%34%42%37%30%66%71">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3505326 href="vote?for=3505326&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%69%65%6e%34%42%37%30%66%71"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3505326></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Kynlyn">Kynlyn</a> 11 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3505326">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>That is not quite how contracting math works out, though.  You have to charge <i>significantly</i> more to account for just the direct costs of your employment (such as payroll tax, half of which is salary that every employee has but is unaware of) and the benefits package.  Basically, you get to pay your own fully loaded costs.  $74 an hour at 40 hour weeks gets you a package similar to that enjoyed by an salaried engineer at $80k to $90k or so.<p>You also tend to charge more than even that calculation suggests, because you're responsible for downtime, overhead in getting new gigs between clients, credit risk, yadda yadda.  The upshot is that you'd probably have a contracting rate in the low three figures.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Patrick, rdouble is not being nice, but his major point is right. There are different forces in play for negotiating engineer's salary than a consulting engagement.<p>Employee compensation within a company needs to be equitable.  Similar work for similar pay.  Whereas terms of a unique consulting engagement don't affect anybody else. This is a huge driver of all kinds of compensation decisions, like standardized salary ranges, etc.<p>You are right about pattern matching.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Sales guys very rarely tie their stomachs in knots with "So I suppose technically I might have talked to five million in new accounts last quarter, but most of them required new features, so I'm not sure I can justifiably claim credit for that one without splitting it with the engineering team."  One might start learning from that example.  Did you lead development on a new product with $5 million in sales?  Then I might describe that as leading development on a new product with $5 million in sales.  I wouldn't recommend optimizing SQL queries on a screen no one actually uses, but if that is your day to day activity, you were improving performance of the company's flagship product which launched to over $5 million in sales.  If you're optimizing page load speed then presumably you tracked the before and after and, if you don't have great data about how that trickled into the business results, you can at least say "I shaved 5 seconds off our dashboard.  Research from Google / Amazon / Microsoft / etc has found that page load speed has the following quantifiable impacts and that the sensitivity is on the order of 100 ms, or roughly one fiftieth of the improvement I delivered."<p>You can also either a) engineer your transfer to the part of the company which makes money or b) engineer your work duties such that they include things which will help career growth.  For example, A/B testing both prints money and gives very relevant, justified metrics which are likely to include things motivational to decisionmakers at current and future employers.  If you are an engineer in a company which doesn't A/B test but could, you should make that sale internally, and then nominate yourself as the obvious person to implement it.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3501734&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%69%65%6e%34%42%37%30%66%71">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3502861 href="vote?for=3502861&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%69%65%6e%34%42%37%30%66%71"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3502861></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=temphn">temphn</a> 11 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3502861">link</a></span></div><br>

It does help to understand that there is some tie-in - ie. as an engineer, that you get that you are essentially building stuff to make money and you are cognizant of the consequences of your work.  On another level it demonstrates that you have status to be in positions of that much importance.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Good managers know that it takes more than the sales guy to close the deal to make that $5MM deal work. The sales people know this, too. Aftermarket support and/or production issues mid-stream are the bane of our existence. When it goes well everyone deserves the credit.<p>Now that I have that experience if I saw a non sales person place something like the above on their resume I would be very intrigued. Not because they're claiming responsibility (which I don't read into that) but because it says to me that they see their place in the whole system and how they contribute. That is really rare and really valuable. Like you say it's harder to see it when you're not in front of the customer, but if you do see it I think it means you're probably an "A" player.<p>For example, I used to sell heavy equipment to the concrete industry. In the back shop there was a manager of a unit that did about 25% of the work that needed to be done to build any machine that I would sell. He didn't have any direct contact with the customers. He didn't sit in on any sales meetings, and didn't have a very good idea of the forecast that was coming (unfortunately). He was absolutely critical to making each sale happen and each customer happy and he seemed to understand this. Without him it would have been very difficult to land the deals that we did. He absolutely deserves to place that he was critical to building an $8_figs business area on his resume. And by doing so I think it shows that he has vision beyond his area. I'd work with him again in a second.<p>He was "far" from the money but it didn't seem that way to me. He could just write on his resume that he was a Tool and Die Maker that managed a small machine shop of about 6 people. And it's true, but it doesn't do him justice.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3502163&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%69%65%6e%34%42%37%30%66%71">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3501931 href="vote?for=3501931&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%69%65%6e%34%42%37%30%66%71"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3501931></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jiggy2011">jiggy2011</a> 12 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3501931">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Just addressing the technical misdirection:<p>"We made a number of technical errors. We decided to try using a brand new datastore called NoDB. Unfortunately, it turned out that our learning curve on NoDB v1.234 was steeper than we expected. It's an amazing product, but it's new and not yet well documented so it took us a long time to learn its quirks. I became an expert on NoDB because of all the tuning I had to do to try to improve performance and it's a fantastic product.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>OK, this may be harsh, but it's true.<p>You come into an interview with me and say that, and you've just talked yourself out of a job. I don't care how impressive your resume is; don't care if otherwise you walk on water. If you can't even avoid expressly criticizing your teammates in a job interview, it sends signals that you don't know when to keep your mouth shut; that you have no idea what it means to be tactful. That in turn suggests to me that you're going to be a pain in the ass to work with and are more focused on "who's right" in a discussion than coming to a consensus.<p>I really, really, really hate the phrase "not a team player" but right or wrong, that's exactly what that statement would advertise.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3502354&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%69%65%6e%34%42%37%30%66%71">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3502433 href="vote?for=3502433&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%69%65%6e%34%42%37%30%66%71"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3502433></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=awj">awj</a> 12 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3502433">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'll back that one up. That exact attitude is something I'm personally working on right now, mostly as a result of discovering how much it affects people's perception of my work and abilities.<p>Talking crap about your previous co-workers is a great way to waste interview time and convince someone you will be difficult to work with. You're in a job interview. This is best-foot-forward, "paint me a picture of how awesome you could be" time. Don't bitch about your last job, we aren't here to talk about that.<p>If the honest answer truly was "everyone else was incompetent", just talk about your role in the project. If everyone was <i>really</i> that terrible and you were <i>really</i> that good, you should have some <i>awesome</i> stories about how you helped keep things on track. Maybe the whole damn thing was a sinking ship, but you have to have done something to help keep it afloat. Tell those stories.<p>Anyone with half a brain will catch on that you're talking around a bad work environment. They'll appreciate your tact and file away a note that letting you talk to customers/sales/management/whoever may not be as horrible as it would with most engineers. That's a <i>very</i> good mark in your favor.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3502433&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%69%65%6e%34%42%37%30%66%71">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3503748 href="vote?for=3503748&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%69%65%6e%34%42%37%30%66%71"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3503748></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jiggy2011">jiggy2011</a> 11 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3503748">link</a></span></div><br>
