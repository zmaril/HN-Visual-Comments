To quickly sketch it out, you want to be on highly visible projects for well-connected folks/firms which have a fairly tight connection to actual money.  This has an astoundingly better ROI than learning Ruby from the perspective of increasing your market value.<p>Don't care about money and want some more opportunities for fun stuff?

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>One thing I've found is that scaling rarely means solving difficult problems.  Rather, it means putting more time into finding optimal solutions to problems that are trivial at smaller scale.  For example, should your startup use Apache, nginx, or HAProxy as a load balancer?  If you're just launching, the answer is "Who cares, just ship the fucking thing!". If you reach the point where you start measuring page views in the billions (and yes there are start ups that are at this point), it matters a great deal.  Or should you use Postgres, MySQL, or some shiny NoSQL thing?  Again, probably doesn't matter for small websites.  But for larger services, it matters.<p>Also, don't underestimate how large log files can grow in a data-driven business (like AirBNB seems to be).

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Even a very strict libertarian should agree to the obvious harm here: the compensation package with Google that the employee negotiated in good faith has a covenant which was not disclosed to them and is materially against their interests, namely, that signing on the dotted line forecloses future avenues which you might want to pursue.  Not only were employees unaware of that, they would have active reasons to believe it would be impossible, because the laws under which that contract was negotiated say in big bold letters that provisions like that are repugnant to the state's sense of justice and will be voided even if spelled out.<p>There's a credible case for allowing people to sign away future opportunities in return for compensation in the present day, even if their counterparty has excessive leverage in that negotiation.  I don't believe it, but I wouldn't think less of you if you do.  There's no credible case for the moral righteousness of secret conspiracy against one's own employees' interests which acts to implement a term that you cannot ask for and expressly deny having sought.<p>It's structurally similar to abuse of overtime.  I happen to think you should be allowed to trade more than 40 hours a week in return of an amount of money you find motivational, if that floats your boat.  In some jurisdictions, that is illegal.  Even if you disagree with that policy, if you're negotiating a contract in those jurisdictions, you're going to assume as part of your offer that you're only agreeing to 40 hours a week for the same reason you assume that negotiating a contract will not secretly obligate you to give them your kidney.  If they then stick you with more than 40 hours a week, that's an abuse, even if you don't agree with the law: if you had been aware of the work routinely requiring more than 40 hours, you would have priced that in, but instead you priced it on the assumption of 40 hours in the mistaken belief that that was an externally imposed maximum.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3517574&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%56%41%41%59%35%52%63%39%4e">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3519208 href="vote?for=3519208&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%56%41%41%59%35%52%63%39%4e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3519208></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jeffem">jeffem</a> 8 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3519208">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Those are fair points, although I did qualify my statement with "In the absence of fraud".  If the employment agreements forbid the behavior then that would be a clear case of fraud.  When it comes to implied expectations, I'm not sure it's so clear.  My understanding is that bilateral agreements with no-hire stipulations are not explicitly illegal, although the court may rule a specific agreement is depending on how it affects competition in a market.  So how many employees actually assumed no non-hire agreements when they signed on and was that a reasonable assumption?  I think that's a difficult question to answer.<p>Either way, I hate that the focus is on the "letter of the law".  If this were a patent troll case, or Hollywood copyright, or if SOPA had passed, how many people here would be demanding damages or jail time from the defendants?  They would be guilty of breaking the law just the same, and the plaintiffs could also claim that they need to be compensated for their losses (cost of filing for patent, "lost revenues" from pirated material, etc.)<p>I have to say, though, that my initial post was poorly worded.  As I was writing it, in my mind, I thought I was railing against antitrust laws in general and describing how non-hire agreements in the abstract were victimless crimes.  Reading those statements again, it seems more like I'm just talking about this particular case.  That's totally my fault, I apologize for that.  I tend to get worked up about issues like this and have to do a better job of choosing my words, or even stop myself from ranting in the first place.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3519208&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%56%41%41%59%35%52%63%39%4e">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3517384 href="vote?for=3517384&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%56%41%41%59%35%52%63%39%4e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3517384></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=patio11">patio11</a> 8 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3517384">link</a> | <a href="item?id=3516314">parent</a> | on: <a href="item?id=3516314">Today Apple, Google, 5 Others Battle “No Poach” Co...</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Sure, and...<p>1. It means they're scared. Companies wouldn't do this if they were afraid of a 10% bump in salaries. They'd just pay it out. That's small compared to the cost incurred by constant churn, code turning into legacy as people leave the company, etc. To pull that shit, they're worried about something larger.<p>2. If they were able to pull that "cartel" off (and such arrangements are inherently unstable, because it's always in the individual interest to break) it would be stupid for them and advantageous for startups. If the big companies hold each other back ("crab mentality") then startups would have less competition for talent.<p>In fact, the second contradicts the intentional over-hiring observed at large companies: why do these huge companies pay $150-250k for people to do mind-numbing, unnecessary maintenance work on zombie projects? (I've seen legacy monsters at large companies with 4 <i>full-time</i> maintainers.) Because they don't want these people in startups that might threaten them, 5 to 10 years down the road.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Sadly, I've been that person.  I read pg essays, blogs about programming and watched various videos about programming for about 3 years before finally deciding to leave my relatively comfortable small-business as an EFL cram-school partner and start actually coding stuff.  People have been absolutely amazed by how little I know compared to how much I sound like I know.<p>Fizzbuzz wouldn't have filtered me out of getting my first (and current) real software job, but any sort of Google/MS-style interview would have.  It may not be the wisest thing to admit to on the internet, but I'm basically in the opposite boat of your general target on HN: I'm fine with selling, but limited (non-EFL) skills to sell!<p>That, along with seeing numerous senior iOS dev applicants struggle both with Fizzbuzz and with Macs in general, has convinced me that it's more than worth it to test candidates without code portfolios.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3516139&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%56%41%41%59%35%52%63%39%4e">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3514034 href="vote?for=3514034&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%56%41%41%59%35%52%63%39%4e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3514034></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jasonlotito">jasonlotito</a> 9 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3514034">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The opposite, of course, is true.  I've never been in a situation in the real world where, given a problem, I jumped immediately to a white board and felt I had to come up with a  solution while being tested by people I didn't know.  I have, however, had the joy of being given questions that could literally not happen, with requirements that cannot be met, all with the intent on seeing how I can think.  Oh, and with no time to think, either.<p>If you really want to test how someone thinks over questions like that, actually give them time.  Give them the questions before they show up for the interview.  Then go over their solutions.  They aren't under pressure, they give you a thoughtful answer, and you get a better sense of what they can do in the real world.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3514034&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%37%56%41%41%59%35%52%63%39%4e">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr style="height:10px"></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=14></td><td class="title"><a href="/x?fnid=tien4B70fq" rel="nofollow">More</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></td></tr><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=10 width=0><table width="100%" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=1><tr><td bgcolor=#ff6600></td></tr></table><br>
