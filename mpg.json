You mentioned above about the goal of increasing comment quality that \"There's a lot we already do about it, and probably other techniques that are yet undiscovered. This is somewhat uncharted territory.\" I'll renew a suggestion here that I think would be helpful.<p>I've been a moderator one place or another online since 1993, and I've seen a lot of online discussion forums attempt to acculturate newbies to civil, thoughtful discussion. One of the most helpful practices that I have observed over the years is making sure that people who use factual assertions to back a position in a discussion are accountable for where one would look up the facts to verify them and ensure they are not made up. (A HUGE percentage of all real-world discourse about controversial issues is based on made-up factual premises.) With that in mind, I'm trying to encourage a culture here of asking people for sources when they make a factual assertion, and providing sources in a first comment when there sources on the issue. (I try to stud most of my comments with links to sources to exemplify this.) So any time any of us see a comment that is dumb, an essential thing to do is to ask the person who made the dumb comment what the basis for the comment is. (\"Do you have a source for that?\" or the more abrupt \"[citation needed]\" as occasion demands, or \"What about [detail of assertion]?\" if that is better for raising the quality of the discussion.) Another thing to do is to share the growing online literature about evaluating sources, such as my very favorite link for Hacker News discussions,<p><a href=\"http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>and links about constructive online participation.<p><a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html</a><p>A lot of stupid comments (and, alas, I have a particular user's example in mind) result from the convenience of reading blogs rather than reading serious scholarly literature. And the paywalls around serious scholarly articles only exacerbate this problem. So I routinely upvote any comment that points to a reliable source, and especially comments that teach other HN participants how to find and access reliable sources.<p>In general, promoting an information-based culture here will have two effects that will help reduce the problem of dumb comments: (1) it will raise the karma and visibility of the better comments that include good information from reliable sources (or that ask for that as follow-ups to worse comments), and (2) it will be off-putting to people inclined to make it up when they are put to their proof for the things they say.", "link": "item?id=3499195", "user": "tokenadult"}, {"comment": "It's not just the comments, I'm more concerned about the submissions.

Warning, if your probabilities are extreme enough, someone might want to bet you on it.<p>Presuming things are different, I see five obvious answers to the original question (and \"all of the above\" is also an option).<p>1)  The amount of regulation and regulatory burden has increased sufficiently between then and now, that new business relationships have a much harder time replacing old destroyed business relationships.  I.e., it's now more expensive to hire a new employee.<p>2)  It's a novel change in the financial side of the economy.  Like, capital-holders now try to make killings by investing in the right HFT funds instead of trying to go out and invest in new businesses.  Implausible?  Maybe, but finance <i>has</i> changed a lot recently, so the difference, if there is one, might be there.<p>3)  The amount of re-education required to get a new job has increased enough to be a killer barrier to re-employment, whether because of employers having imposed an arbitrary demand for bachelors' degrees or because the jobs are actually more complex.<p>4)  Ricardo's Law does allow individual regions to lose as a result of tech improvements, because if someone else beats your comparative advantage, people will want to trade with them instead of you.  There's nothing ahistorical about the Rust Belt having a persistent recession within the US.  This is now happening to the whole US; people no longer want to trade with us, but China is growing plenty.<p>5)  The Thiel hypothesis:  Recent technological developments are intrinsically more boring than past technological developments; people are trying to build web apps that will sell to Google for $10 million instead of trying to invent the next \"microchip\" or \"electricity\".  It's not that the 21st century poses a novel obstacle to forming new business relationships to replace old ones; rather, 21st-century technologies that obsolete jobs are missing a wow factor or wealth-generating factor that previously increased demand or increased total wealth at the same time as obsoleting jobs.", "link": "item?id=2852062", "user": "Eliezer"}, {"comment": "@pg- see Page 2 &#38; 3 of this paper for actual A/B testing results on the coupon code issue<p><a href=\"http://cginsights.posterous.com/hippo-ab-testing\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://cginsights.posterous.com/hippo-ab-testing</a>", "link": "item?id=2846362", "user": "nrao123"}, {"comment": "Yeah, craziness.

That is, even if the existence of a patent monopoly produces some technological benefits as compared to a non-monopolistic system, we would choose freedom from monopoly.<p>John Carmack may have stated the essence of this position better than anyone since Jefferson [1]:<p>\"The idea that I can be presented with a problem, set out to logically solve it with the tools at hand, and wind up with a program that could not be legally used because someone else followed the same logical steps some years ago and filed for a patent on it is horrifying.\" -- John Carmack<p>[1] \"If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.\"  -- Thomas Jefferson", "link": "item?id=2947541", "user": "tc"}, {"comment": "Of course, the bulk of the valuation is in the startups that have grown enough.

We're not doing lawyers, but I think lawyers are a good example of why the Yelp UX model is wrong for the \"relationship\" business services market.<p>- First, reviews are the wrong content. You won't get them, first of all, because customers of businesses who see 10-20 engagements per year will never leave lukewarm or negative reviews. Secondly, even if you only allow recommendations (like LinkedIn) and not open reviews, it's still the wrong content to describe a complex business service. The managing partner of WSGR has tons of recommendations on LI. Does one of them come close to capturing how he thinks about business or his potential value? No.<p>- Second, stars or any other standard comparison ranking system is the wrong discovery method. Stars help people discover who is good, but not who is good at what.<p>- Third, participation. LawPivot, who was able to raise several million dollars, lets lawyers generate business through a private Q&#38;A site. Well, the most successful lawyers have no reason to use this service- they are already oversubscribed.

That is, given how much Drew had already done, a cofounder had to be mostly just downside risk.  The 'mitigation' had to be minimal.<p>Or, Drew's left hand doesn't fight with his right hand, but cofounders can easily fight.<p>If a cofounder is really needed, then so be it.  But a cofounder is always risky, and a single founder who has already done well starting the business has a big advantage just because his left hand won't fight with his right hand.<p>Now a single founder can do much more than in past years, even just five years ago.<p>And here's a big point:  always in a startup very much want the CEO to 'understand his business'.  In an IT software startup, that includes understanding the software.  But software has now changed:  E.g., with .NET, nearly everything needed in commercial computing, and a larger fraction of Web site construction, is already in the .NET classes.  So, the work is just writing a little 'glue' code between the uses of the classes.  So, the coding goes VERY quickly.  But what doesn't go quickly is understanding the classes because need about 10 books each of 500-1000 pages and, even for just a Web site, about 3000 Web pages of documentation from MSDN.  And, this understanding of .NET is just 'overhead' that have to pay just once per programming task solved with a .NET class actually understand well.  So, to 'know his business', a CEO needs to know the relevant parts of, say, .NET.  A cofounder can't help here.  And once the CEO does have that .NET knowledge, there can be some serious question if a cofounder can add much.  Just what the Linux world has in place of .NET I don't know, but it can't be both small and effective.<p>There is other evidence:  Look up and down Main Street at the successful businesses that have been started there.  Typically there's only one person who is the real 'founder'.  Look at research:  Bright ideas come first to just one person at a time.  Period.  Microsoft:  A Bill Gates show.

What made me realize this was going to Africa and seeing lots of animals in the wild. All or nearly all the big mammals lived in groups and cooperated to survive. It was clear that our ancestors would in their day have been one of these groups, also cooperating to survive (as hunter-gatherers still do in a few places), and that their cooperative inclinations were probably genetically preprogrammed.<p>I'm not sure living in groups and cooperating implies a genetic predisposition to equality. Even though a group might have, say, twenty to fifty members, some members tend to rule and others tend to hang on the outskirts. I'd pick Venkat Rao's division into Sociopaths, Clueless, and Losers (<a href=\"http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-o...</a>) as the best way to divide up types of people in such a group. He writes about their role in businesses, but it's the same in a small societal group. The Sociopaths are the jocks who absolutely must have the power, eat the most food, and have the most offspring. The Losers are the ones who live at the edge of the group, eat the least food, and be eaten first by predators. The Clueless are the majority who follow the Sociopaths' rules and rise slowly through the group hierarchy to their natural level of competence.<p>Perhaps society is best modeled as a cell, where the Sociopaths are the nucleus and the Losers are the membrane. It does seem to be a male-oriented model, where females act more like glue, facilitating relationships. The male Sociopaths would have two or more females each, eat the food, feed the women, and produce the most offspring. The male Clueless would only have one female and follow whatever other rules the Sociopaths impose, and get food based on their rank in society. Perhaps the females overall are most similar to male Clueless in this model.<p>The male Losers would be the first to miss out on the food, not get any girls, and die young, being the first to be sacrificed to predators. And maybe there's the reason why Sociopaths naturally shun any interaction with Losers, going through the Clueless intermediaries, as in \"the jocks hate the nerds\". When there's any threat to their survival or status, the Sociopaths in the nucleus can't afford to have any emotional attachment to the Losers in the outer membrane. They need to be able to sacrifice Losers without hesitating if that's required for their own survival.<p>I guess I'm saying not only are mammals built out of biological cells internally, but also make up societal cells externally. When there's plenty of food and the group grows too big, the Sociopaths start electioneering among the Clueless for loyalty. The group will eventually split in half, just like cells do, some Sociopaths taking some of the Clueless with them and the others taking the other Clueless. When there's just enough food for the Sociopaths to multiply but not enough Clueless for a successful cell split, the Sociopaths will turn on one another, a coup takes place, and the losing Sociopaths killed or thrown outside the membrane.<p>This model describes how a genetic predisposition to inequality and hierarchy can also explain group living and apparent cooperation.", "link": "item?id=2983062", "user": "vorg"}, {"comment": "We encouraged him to find one, but Drew found one himself.", "link": "item?id=3069581", "user": "pg"}, {"comment": "I'm not pg, but let's see if I can give this one a shot.<p>In response to your question, you want people who are all awesome (although it looks like you've already come to this conclusion on your own).

At the end of the day, when you get right down to it, entering the first few letters of a url then selecting the correct site is both an arbitrary, and not particularly optimized workflow.  The fact that we are used to it does not mean there aren't far better systems out there.  Sure, Chrome on my MBP has learned to take me to my top 10 sites with cmd-l -&#62; $url[0] -&#62; enter, but my mom <i>needs</i> her buttons on the bookmark bar.  I tried to remove the titles, thinking she could easily recognize the favicons, but no dice.  She needs a start menu-like interface.<p>Similarly, I was on the bus with my friend, browsing reddit.  He buys tons of apps for his iPhone, and he looks at my screen and says, \"is their mobile app free?\"  I said, \"well, yes, but most people just browse to reddit.com/.compact\".  he stared at me in disbelief.  Why would you use the browser if you can have an app?<p>For those of us who live and breath the Internet, it seems only natural that a write-once-run-anywhere website would be  more appealing than having to download some stupid app from some stupid store, type in your password, then have to remember which home screen it's on, etc.  For those who use the internet as <i>casual content consumers</i>, however, apps take a lot of the frustration out of it.  Want to read the economist?  Tap the economist button.  That's it.  Want to watch a youtube video?  Tap the youtube button.  Need directions?  Tap the map button.<p>For the casual user, these workflows are far more intuitive.  My friend, who has spent hundreds of dollars in the App Store, rarely uses the browser on his phone.  He uses the Plenty of Fish app, the Chive app, etc.  For most non-technical users, this just makes sense.  It might seem annoying to us, but we are not the largest market segment by far.<p>Now it might be that we'll see mobile web sites with a light wrapper disguised as apps; perhaps cache and a link that opens in the browser.  Maybe we'll see native support for the kinds of things that are typically done in the browser.  But, crucially, what I don't think we'll see is the dominance of mobile web over native clients.

Latin is a highly inflected language, meaning that individual words carry almost all of the grammatical information necessary to parse a sentence.

What made me realize this was going to Africa and seeing lots of animals in the wild. All or nearly all the big mammals lived in groups and cooperated to survive. It was clear that our ancestors would in their day have been one of these groups, also cooperating to survive (as hunter-gatherers still do in a few places), and that their cooperative inclinations were probably genetically preprogrammed.<p>I'm not sure living in groups and cooperating implies a genetic predisposition to equality. Even though a group might have, say, twenty to fifty members, some members tend to rule and others tend to hang on the outskirts. I'd pick Venkat Rao's division into Sociopaths, Clueless, and Losers (<a href=\"http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-o...</a>) as the best way to divide up types of people in such a group. He writes about their role in businesses, but it's the same in a small societal group. The Sociopaths are the jocks who absolutely must have the power, eat the most food, and have the most offspring. The Losers are the ones who live at the edge of the group, eat the least food, and be eaten first by predators. The Clueless are the majority who follow the Sociopaths' rules and rise slowly through the group hierarchy to their natural level of competence.<p>Perhaps society is best modeled as a cell, where the Sociopaths are the nucleus and the Losers are the membrane. It does seem to be a male-oriented model, where females act more like glue, facilitating relationships. The male Sociopaths would have two or more females each, eat the food, feed the women, and produce the most offspring. The male Clueless would only have one female and follow whatever other rules the Sociopaths impose, and get food based on their rank in society. Perhaps the females overall are most similar to male Clueless in this model.<p>The male Losers would be the first to miss out on the food, not get any girls, and die young, being the first to be sacrificed to predators. And maybe there's the reason why Sociopaths naturally shun any interaction with Losers, going through the Clueless intermediaries, as in \"the jocks hate the nerds\". When there's any threat to their survival or status, the Sociopaths in the nucleus can't afford to have any emotional attachment to the Losers in the outer membrane. They need to be able to sacrifice Losers without hesitating if that's required for their own survival.<p>I guess I'm saying not only are mammals built out of biological cells internally, but also make up societal cells externally. When there's plenty of food and the group grows too big, the Sociopaths start electioneering among the Clueless for loyalty. The group will eventually split in half, just like cells do, some Sociopaths taking some of the Clueless with them and the others taking the other Clueless. When there's just enough food for the Sociopaths to multiply but not enough Clueless for a successful cell split, the Sociopaths will turn on one another, a coup takes place, and the losing Sociopaths killed or thrown outside the membrane.<p>This model describes how a genetic predisposition to inequality and hierarchy can also explain group living and apparent cooperation.", "link": "item?id=2983062", "user": "vorg"}, {"comment": "In the past they've paid about as much attention to the startups as they would have if they'd done a seed investment of the same size a la carte.", "link": "item?id=3113242", "user": "pg"}, {"comment": "I wouldn't say they are consciously planting them.

I don't assume that all economic inequality is the medieval type, where the rich are the winners of a zero sum game.</i><p>The problem I see with growing income inequality is not the \"inequality\" part, it's the \"growing\" one.<p>From a purely mathematical point of view, in any economic climate there's some level of income inequality that's going to be economically optimal for whatever it is that we want to optimize about our economy (some combination of jobs, happiness, wealth, or whatever).  This is trivially true, as zero income inequality is a really crappy situation by most realistic measures of economic health, as is ultimate income inequality (i.e. a small handful of people holding all the wealth).  In between those extremes there's <i>got</i> to be some optimal distribution of wealth.<p>But when I see a march towards higher levels of inequality, I'm left to wonder whether there are actually any forces in play that will keep us anywhere near that optimum, or if we're just seeing a runaway \"wealth begets wealth\" situation, as folks like Mandelbrot have suggested.  Sure, it <i>could</i> be the case that the changing technological climate means that the optimal level of inequality is going up, and we're actually keeping pace with that, but that's just a \"could be\", and I've never seen a particularly compelling argument that our economy should work more efficiently now at higher levels of income inequality than, say, twenty years ago.

But I don't agree that it's not cause for concern: we're sliding at an increasing pace down the slippery slope, and at the bottom is complete human level AI, where a vanishing percentage of humans have anything at all of value to offer to the economy.  Are you <i>really</i> comfortable with the wealth distribution that's going to result from such a thing?<p>Personally (and this is quite controversial, I admit), I think that we have to start taking that inevitable outcome to heart, and realizing that the next 50 years should be a period where we move a lot closer to a full welfare state, with full acceptance of the fact that more and more of us will be at the unemployed and useless end of the spectrum as time goes on.

From a political standpoint, it's electability; yet if we're too far into the inequality part of the spectrum, the fixes take more than an election cycle, and therefore require strong political leadership or near dictatorship (think FDR and no term limits as a model; think Japan and its many prime ministers over the last decade and stagnation as the counterexample).  That's not promising since it may mean only the Senate, with its six-year terms and only 1/3 of the membership up for re-election has a long enough time-frame to do what's needed.<p>But what about from a business perspective--what incentives and forces are there today in business to try to close that income gap?  Henry Ford allegedly paid well and understood that he needed to create a market for what he made, yet the auto industry today can't close that gap alone.  If Apple's prominence in the economy is comparable to Ford's, what hope is there that the jobs they create in China will create a positive feedback loop of income equality?  Perhaps with a global perspective it will.<p>Therefore, I come to the conclusion that the Ford Motor of the 21st century will be a company that is able to further its own market by empowering its customers (and the common, untrained person) to become value creators from an economic standpoint.  You see Google and Apple and even eBay nibbling around the edges, but who is going to emerge that harnesses and transmutes that latent economic power?<p>[1] <a href=\"http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/09/07/pm-the-new-normal-not-so-normal/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/09/07/pm...</a>", "link": "item?id=2980915", "user": "firebones"}, {"comment": "Sure, and there's probably a subset in there that would actually be successful with someone else but just have a personality mismatch with Paul.

So while re-ranking your site may kill your business, you're not a user and that re-ranking makes the experience better for our users.

Users are not going to stop searching for something to buy just because they have to scroll the results page.  If the social features <i>are</i> relevant, though, then users are getting a better experience.  And that's a good thing, even if individual pages get less traffic from Google.  Instead of being able to SEO the entire Internet, businesses can now only affect the search results for a tiny percentage of users.  That's a good thing because SEO can't scale, and SEO isn't good for users or the Internet at large.<p>If you look at the Google experience from the standpoint of customers, it's pretty good.  Users get relevant search results and ads.  Advertisers get their content on top of everything else.  It's a good compromise between advertising and usability, and it works really well.  It's a bug that you could rank highly in Google without buying ads, and Google is trying to fix the bug.  Manipulating Google results shouldn't be something you feel entitled to be able to do.

That's all fine and well if we're only talking technology, but a number of companies increasingly invest in a dual strategy where they also make governments do their bidding when it comes to technology - that started out with software patents (clearly a pandoras box, opened, now) which are already harming innovation and is now leading into things like SOPA where, transparently, policy is proposed to 'fix' the technological empowerment that we have enjoyed on the Internet for so long in favor of protecting the deep pockets of a few corporations.<p>Remember - technology is only a tool and what happens with that tool is always guided by the ones who yield the most power. It was possible for Apple to eliminate DRM only because they maneuvered themselves into a position of power where media corporations were being lead by Apple and not the other way around. I think the actual reason why DRM was abandoned was because it was just not feasible, for music - remember the horror stories with Windows DRM for music, for instance. Removing DRM was both damage control by Apple and a 'hip' thing to do in the wake of consumer dissatisfaction. I have yet to see a similar push in any other field than music - extremely restrictive licensing and DRM are still alive and well in proprietary software and video content, respectively, and it doesn't seem like there is any change to that on the horizon. It probably helps that the Apple-&#62;Jobs-&#62;Pixar-&#62;Disney link is a very strong one and that video content is used fundamentally different compared to music.<p>Anyhow - it's always both - big corporations do have to pay attention to the market and both follow the will of the consumer and what is best for their own bottom line, which sometimes overlap. But sometimes they get weary of that and short circuit the system through politics (although <i>that</i> is often initiated by companies that are not primarily in technology).

Or whether non-suffering humans are OK to kill and eat?<p>Even if you continue with your line, there are other ways you could argue it - if suffering is bad, then that doesn't mean eating animals is bad, you could tranquillise before killing and it would be OK. Or if you want to minimise suffering then wild animals aren't OK, and all animals should have a human managed lifespan from sedated birth to anaesthetised death followed by being eaten, and not-eating-animals but leaving them to die \"naturally\" is worse.<p>And there's room to step back and say suffering is a behaviour and thought pattern that's only of interest to the creature connected to that nervous system - otherwise of no interest, so why go for 'minimise suffering' at all? You could argue about methane emissions or water/other resource use, for why it's unethical to prioritise farming animals for food, or you could look at it as a social signalling - wanting to signal that we understand suffering and choose to avoid it or as a personal suffering (guilt) reduction aside from the animal suffering, or you could believe in a deity which punishes you after death for animal suffering you caused.<p>But however you look at it, you come back to: humans have to eat, so plants or animals have to be ethically OK to eat, and we don't want hurt selves or relatives and friends, so cannibalism can't be OK, but within that, whether extending compassion to animals is \"right\" or not, it's not objective - refusing to eat farm animals because the calculation on their methane emissions leading to global warming effects and future human suffering would be, but where the ethical line in farming living creatures for food is, is not.

We can only tell if philosophy is useful in retrospect, by the impact a work has. Philosophy is not like science, where we know we are 'doing science' by performing experiments. But it also is like science, in that we judge it's use retrospectively.<p>A good example of philosophy being useful is the case of Bertrand Russell's work on 'Russell's Paradox'. Russell's work in the Principia Mathematica was partially about formulating definitions that would free us of this paradox.<p>PG says <i>\"Outside of math there's a limit to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise meanings.\"</i><p>Surely there is use in forming these precise meanings in the first place. Some (not all) of that work is philosophy.<p>Russell's work was outside of math, or at a minimum it was 'Meta-math'. Russell was attempting to crystallize new logical definitions that could form precise definitions, and hence become mathematics. He was trying to create mathematics from philosophy.<p>Did it work? No. The Principia Mathematica was a failure. But the way it failed, it failed as a piece of mathematics, at the hands of Kurt Godel. Here is a case of philosophy becoming mathematics. In short, Godel's work leads to the work of Church and Turing, which leads to the computer.<p>So we can at least point to the concrete usefulness of some philosophy, retrospectively.

But does it? I think its functional importance is in asking questions in such a way they can be answered by experiment.<p>So in the philosophy of mind, the functional role of philosophy is to refine concepts so there is a conceptual difference that makes a difference in experiment.<p>The problem is, there is no way to tell if you are doing useful philosophy if we define its function as creating the conditions for experiment to take over. We can only tell if philosophy is useful in retrospect, by the impact a work has. Philosophy is not like science, where we know we are 'doing science' by performing experiments. But it also is like science, in that we judge it's use retrospectively.<p>A good example of philosophy being useful is the case of Bertrand Russell's work on 'Russell's Paradox'. Russell's work in the Principia Mathematica was partially about formulating definitions that would free us of this paradox.<p>PG says <i>\"Outside of math there's a limit to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise meanings.\"</i><p>Surely there is use in forming these precise meanings in the first place. Some (not all) of that work is philosophy.<p>Russell's work was outside of math, or at a minimum it was 'Meta-math'. Russell was attempting to crystallize new logical definitions that could form precise definitions, and hence become mathematics. He was trying to create mathematics from philosophy.<p>Did it work? No. The Principia Mathematica was a failure. But the way it failed, it failed as a piece of mathematics, at the hands of Kurt Godel. Here is a case of philosophy becoming mathematics. In short, Godel's work leads to the work of Church and Turing, which leads to the computer.<p>So we can at least point to the concrete usefulness of some philosophy, retrospectively.

You are correct that Gates, Jobs, and Buffett are not perfect examples of successful sole founders, but the question is, can a sole founder be successful?  The 'rub' in this question is, can just one guy, alone, making all the decisions alone, do well?  Then the examples of Gates, Jobs, and Buffett are quite relevant because each did great things essentially alone.<p>For Jobs, whatever might say about Woz and Jobs's first period at Apple, later Jobs did very well alone at Next, Pixar, and back at Apple.  For those last three gigs, Woz was somewhere in the nickel seats.  Yes, the success with Woz gave Jobs a lot of cash that was no doubt important for him in his last three gigs.  So, then we say that Jobs is an example of a three time successful sole founder with cash.  So, with cash a sole founder can work.<p>After the success of MS/DOS and Allen leaving Microsoft, Gates really had to reinvent, 'refound' the company.  It is fair to say that he was a founder again.  Yes, he was a founder with cash, but he was still acting essentially alone.  Again, the issue is, can a sole founder do it alone, and that is what we are addressing.  With the cash from MS/DOS, Gates did it alone.  It's amazing what he did because he crushed IBM, Sun, Lotus, Netscape, DB2, and more.<p>For Buffett, no way should we count Ben Graham!  He wrote a book and was a prof of Buffett at Columbia and possibly a friend.  Graham had likely hundreds of students and millions of readers, but there was just one Berkshire.  So, for Berkshire I don't credit Graham.<p>For Munger's role, that's just a judgment call, but my reading is that Buffett didn't much need him.  Partly I draw that conclusion because it appears in recent years Buffett has been making his decisions essentially just alone.<p>Again, the main issue is, can a sole founder really get the work done or will he go off the deep end, for fast women, slow horses, cheap booze, wacko ideas, etc.?  Well, Gates, Jobs, and Buffett didn't do any of these bad things.<p>There's another great example:  Fred Smith at FedEx.

However, it is the qualities (value neutral) of the parenting that determines outcome rather than the richness of the environment. To quote Paul Tough, who gives a good summary of the research:<p>\"The disadvantages that poverty imposes on children aren't primarily about material goods. True, every poor child would benefit from having more books in his home and more nutritious food to eat (and money certainly makes it easier to carry out a program of concerted cultivation). But the real advantages that middle-class children gain come from more elusive processes: the language that their parents use, the attitudes toward life that they convey. However you measure child-rearing, middle-class parents tend to do it differently than poor parents; and the path they follow in turn tends to give their children an array of advantages. As Lareau points out, kids from poor families might be nicer, they might be happier, they might be more polite; but in countless ways, the manner in which they are raised puts them at a disadvantage in the measures that count in contemporary American society.\"", "link": "item?id=3208922", "user": "Alex3917"}, {"comment": "The usual equation for startups is \"This has a small chance to change the world.\" Fiddling around with the non-world-changing outcomes is premature optimization, since the best exits come from failing to change the world and merely creating a viable business (look at Paypal; they wanted to upend the world's financial system, and instead they had a billion-plus exit facilitating Beanie Baby trades).<p>The median is more representative of what a founder's expected financial return is, but many folks aren't optimizing for that.

As long as the content is engaging and fun for viewers, it will eventually eat into Hollywood's revenue pie.<p>I believe that currently, in order to \"kill\" Hollywood, the first step is to shrink the role of the middlemen by enabling content creators to distribute and market their content effectively online. In fact, the internet has provided a great way to do just that (it is the perfect distribution and marketing channel)! All of us are constantly sharing and reproducing the content and this helps expose users with all sorts of content. Now if there is a startup which focuses on \"following\" and \"chasing\" the content and sell products related to the content itself, I believe that many users will buy the products that interest them. For instance, when we watch \"Mission Impossible\" we may be interested in the music tracks, the movie DVD, the clothes that the characters are wearing, toys &#38; merchandises etc. If more products are being sold, this is a reflection of the quality of the content itself. Product companies would then want to sponsor and fund for quality content creators to carry on producing content. Apart from that such a platform may allow more quality content to be placed on Youtube where users are abundant!<p>The next step is to make content interactive. PG mention \"what are people going to do for fun in 20 years instead of what they do now?\" and I thought of the notion of having the viewers of the content to dictate the direction of the show and making the content engaging that it makes me feel like I am part of it. Currently in many games (esp rpg) I decide the route/path that the character follows and this leads to different game endings. This can be applied to movies as well. A movie can have 4 parts and after each part, the movie may request me to buy a certain choice (eg. the character has 3 roads to choose, which do you choose and this will dictate the progression of the story) or product (there are 3 guns to choose, buy 1 from your local store lol! and key in product keycode or something). This can tie in very well with the idea on paragraph 1 where product companies can help sponsor for the video production.<p>What do you think about these ideas?

What you should really be trying to to do, is found a new AIP or New World Pictures.  <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman#.22The_Corman_Film_School.22\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman#.22The_Corman_Film...</a><p>You want to create a place dedicated to locating and attracting young talent (directors, writers, actors, and producers) that's capable of producing high volumes of low cost product.  You want to design a golden era Hollywood studio for the modern age.<p>This studio would have two main components.  Production and distribution.  The production side is essentially a no brainer.  You grow a pool of talent, and you keep that talent working 8 days a week, producing a diverse slate of low cost filmed entertainment on an aggressive schedule.  Ideally, pictures would take 12 days to shoot, and would have budgets in the thousands instead of the millions.  You'd be producing so many stories, that you could afford to make them highly specialized in their appeal - you wouldn't have to generate \"four quad\" films, you could instead afford to cater to smaller audiences but satisfy those smaller audiences more completely.  People have tuned off Hollywood films in the last decade because those films have become too focused on mass market appeal - in having \"something for everyone\" they have instead produced stories with something for no one.  The idea of our hypothetical studio is to reverse that trend.  Tell stories that only appeal to select audiences, but REALLY appeal to those audiences.<p>This leads to the second half of our hypothetical studio (and frankly, being a filmmaker and not a businessman, the half that I have less competence with): distribution.  This would in fact be the more critical and difficult component of the company to build, because it would be the side dedicated to identifying, locating, and reaching those smaller, more specialized audiences.  Our creative talent - the writers, directors and actors - tells the stories, and our distribution team gets those stories in front of the right audiences.  It wouldn't take long for a deep and sustaining feedback loop to develop between the two halves of our studio - close communication with our audiences would give the creators more guidance in learning what works and what doesn't on screen, leading to better stories which would grow a more dedicated audience or fan base.  In their own ways, this is what Kevin Smith and Joss Whedon have done by reaching out to and learning from their fan bases.<p>The hypothetical studio I've outlined is exactly what golden age studios did to great effect before theater ownership became a losing battle and the star system began to crumble.  In the modern era, we have the advantage of dramatically lowered distribution costs - a computer in every home - but the disadvantage of a greater signal to noise ratio.  But this system - small studios producing a high volume of targeted stories at low cost - has proved repeatable and profitable.  You could make the argument that Corman, with AIP and New World Pictures, saved Hollywood filmmaking during the New Hollywood period by using exactly the system I've outlined above to locate and nurture new talent while maintaining a high profitability.<p>So anyways.  That's what I think.  We shouldn't be focused on producing a new form of entertainment.  As consumers, we don't really need or want a new medium; the bump and decline of 3D sales has proved this, I think.  Novelty only carries you so far.  What is needed is instead a more economically savvy model, focused on generating stories geared towards smaller audiences that will embrace those stories more passionately.  We need a studio that will take as it's battle cry \"We'd rather be nine people's favorite thing than 100 people's ninth favorite thing.\" (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAFo3kONbdE\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAFo3kONbdE</a>)  You need a new Roger Corman.

The zero inequality thing has been tried and failed.<p>2) one of his arguments is that better education of the poor will increase wealth inequality, because it will increase the number of customers and the number of possible entrepreneurs.<p>While the premises are no doubt true, the conclusion isn't. There are other inequality-decreasing factors that might well have a stronger impact. At the very least, a better educated population might have the wherewithal to organize and vote for increased taxes on wealthy people. Less cynically, better educated people need less stuff to get by (e.g. their cars last longer), and they are savvier consumers. And empirically, if one excludes the U.S., the best educated countries tend to also have the lowest income inequality.<p>3) pg neglects the <i>costs</i> of U.S. monetary policy on risk taking. The past 20 years have seen low inflation. When inflation is low, there is less need for money to be invested in order to preserve wealth.  With higher rates of inflation, investors have no choice but to try and extract greater value out of the wealth they have if they want to keep up.<p>4) A related point: pg's argument is that high taxes reduce the large rewards founders get, causing them to take smaller risks. Yet there is nothing intrinsic about taxation that necessitates the burden fall primarily on the recently wealthy. PG's argument doesn't easily apply to \"old money\" -- would the decrease in upside of a wealth tax outweigh the incentives to invest imposed by a wealth tax?<p>From a tech progress/startup perspective, wouldn't the elimination of capital gains in favor of a tax on wealth cause exactly the <i>right</i> kinds of incentives for starting companies?", "link": "item?id=2980357", "user": "leot"}, {"comment": "I agree with your point on education vs. schooling.

Best case scenario for a startup is to spark a totally new niche and find a totally new audience, but this is rare. Most startups just end up replacing brick and mortar businesses of old and eating their paying customer base. This is economics at its finest, and most definitely leads to a poor outcome for the businesses which are cannibalized.<p>Labeling people as \"good\" and \"bad\" is a futile exercise. Capitalism is a mad scramble to extract wealth from everyone else as fast as possible, with whatever means necessary. To do this lawfully, you usually need to provide some value to paying customers. However, many businesses do it by simply convincing customers that they are receiving value, and do very well (e.g. Zynga).<p>From the tone of your article, it appears you have just understood that this system will lead to severe wealth inequality spanning orders of magnitude. This is again, a perfectly well understood outcome of the system. The societal and moral ramifications have been largely ignored due to the imbalance of power between owners of capital and those without. Thus, to have a say in the game, one must play it, and become very successful (i.e. a billionaire). In the process of becoming a billionaire, you will find that your views on this matter will change very rapidly in tandem with your net worth. Before you know it, you are advocating for less capital gains tax, more free trade and reduced government. You will see those Occupy Wall St. protesters as pathetic hooligans and low lives, who simply lack the motivation and willpower to make something of themselves. You will petition congress to protect your business interests, and pay handsomely to do so. You will support politicians who maintain order and those who crack down fiercely on all forms of business which are in direct competition to your own. If you are a film industry exec, you will lobby very hard (with SOPA and PIPA, perhaps) against new distribution channels such as Megavideo, Piratebay, etc. which give content away without due royalties. You will be apathetic to anyone who does not understand how this world works, particularly those with low or no net worth who have no say in these important decisions.<p>Welcome to the game of life.

On the one hand, you may see \"your side\" heavily lower than \"the opposition\", and decide \"ugh, it's pointless\". On the other, you may go \"ok, that's just not fair\", or \"help out the team\", and make extra certain to vote on that specific poll.<p>Due to these attitudes, which are pretty much the same things that are driving the changes in behavior with respect to comment voting, you don't get accurate information with public live polls. This really is the same effect, and should be thought of and treated the same.<p>Now, making the entire poll /permanently/ only visible to the poster would mean, as you say, that the poll becomes meaningless. However, I would say that's a strawman: there are numerous other ways to handle the situation that still make sense.<p>Example: polls could be private until they \"time out\", at which point the poll is no longer votable on, and the data becomes public. Frankly, this seems correct, and I'm glad dlss brought it up (although apparently people disagree with the way he worded it or something, which seems silly).<p>(I also think that this behavior would dovetail very well with \"show the comment scores after people can no longer vote on them\", which came up elsewhere in the comments for this post: <a href=\"http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3122362\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3122362</a> .)", "link": "item?id=3123985", "user": "saurik"}], "children": null}, {"number": 1, "names": "pbhjpbhj", "comments": [{"comment": "&#62;<i>Without publicly viewable results, polls are absolutely meaningless to everyone except the poster.</i> //<p>Voting is a mini-poll on a comment.

More students enrolled means more state funding, so school districts make efforts to provide attractive programs that will bring students across district lines. This competition among school districts has promoted innovation in programs and resulted in a fair amount of interchange among students who live in different neighborhoods. School districts compete with one another by offeringprograms for fine-arts-inclined students, or students who desire language immersion programs (Spanish immersion and Chinese immersion programs are both hot programs in Minnesota), and students with many other characteristics. Some school districts gain almost half of their enrollment from open enrollment, and correspondingly some of the historically worst school districts in Minnesota have lost large percentages of enrollment to families crossing district boundaries to look for better schools. (Minnesota also has a huge number of charter schools, which is a distinct form of competition for publicly subsidized students, but they cannot offer some of the programs that public school districts can.) This competition keeps all districts accountable for providing a good learning environment, and helps change the psychology of teachers and principals dealing with families from one of treating learners as a burden to one of treating learners as an opportunity to be grateful for.<p>Any other state in the United States could do the same, and a few already have.<p><a href=\"http://educateiowa.gov/index.php?option=com_content&#38;task=view&#38;id=649&#38;Itemid=636\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://educateiowa.gov/index.php?option=com_content&#38;task...</a><p><a href=\"http://www.ecs.org/html/offsite.asp?document=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eecs%2Eorg%2FOpenEnrollmentDatabase\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ecs.org/html/offsite.asp?document=http%3A%2F%2Fww...</a><p><i>abolishing private schools</i><p>Abolishing private schools is a distinctly bad idea (as shown by the example of the Netherlands, where multiple kinds of schools receive public funding on a per-capita basis) and anyway is unconstitutional in the United States.

Why would the signup IP be anonymous?  I only created a \"new\" HN handle because I didn't have one before, and making a handle on HN takes like four seconds (kudos HN team).  I lurk on HN.  There's no conspiracy here, and I'm not even sure to which of us you are ascribing fell motives.<p>Anyway, to actually add some relevant content to this thread in case anyone reads this, it's worth thinking for a second about what me and pg are talking about.  For example, when he says someone bought a fund of Conway's, they were buying a portfolio, that's an interesting point.<p>Let's say you are a hedge fund.  The hedge fund has some volume of LPs.  The fund itself has no \"capital\" /in the fund/ (for this example).  The owners themselves are additionally LPs, but the fund is paid 2% of the AUM and a further 20% of returns in excess of a benchmark blah blah blah.<p>It's perfectly possible to acquire this fund without acquiring the portfolio at all: the ownership of the portfolio remains with the LPs.  This is similar to buying a bank.  You don't think of yourself as buying the deposits the bank holds, right?  The scale of the deposits, as well as the scale of the AUM for the hedge fund, are a large determinant in the value of the enterprise because their revenues are a function of this number, but you don't own it.<p>What pg is talking about is different.  If Conway sells a fully invested portfolio, ownership of those positions transfers from Conway and his LPs to the new person, but there is likely still a residual firm there, albeit with minimal assets: copiers, chairs, computers.  The entity that exists to decide where to make investments is financially separable from the investments.<p>The thing is, with a VC fund, there is just...no one has ever built a VC fund that was so awesome that it was worth money on it's own, where it couldn't make MORE money by just investing capital on behalf of its own LPs.  This is partly because VC is a very difficult business to scale (it's also partly because most VCs are not good at their jobs, if you consider their jobs to be generating investment returns, rather than accreting LP capital).  Generally, if you take a VC who runs a $100m and give him $1bn, he can't generate the same returns on that fund.<p>In fact, cash flooding the VC market in general hurts VC returns because contrary to popular belief the \"investment ground\" (which, for most VC funds, is actually a limited geographic area, market, and bite size) generates only so many good deals per unit time.<p>For other types of investment, this is not the case, and they may benefit from economies of scale.  Say your investment strategy is to roll deposits into longer-term high-grade securities.  Have more money, make more money.  In fact, return on capital goes up because this business has economies of scale, unlike VC investing.<p>Other investment firms will fall somewhere in between: there are hedge funds who, with access to greater capital (essentially a distribution problem in hedge funds.  For example, if you work at a large firm with a lot of high net worth individuals, the firm may set up 401k-type plans with hedge funds.  GS employees, for instance, can choose to put their money in AQR Capital instead of say...a Vanguard index fund or whatever you have your workplace, access to this distribution can be a huge boon for hedge funds who's model scales.  Unfortunately most hedge fund managers are terrible at their jobs and their strategies are losing to begin with, never mind scale (unless you look at their strategy as \"making money for myself\", in that case most of them are geniuses.  Even if you barely ever beat a benchmark like the S&#38;P and it takes you a lot of risk and cost to do so, you still get paid extremely lavishly if you are effective at raising large amounts of capital).<p>This is why you occasionally see banks acquiring hedge funds (although, honestly, I think this is generally a pretty bad strategy).  They aren't acquiring the portfolio of investments, like pg is describing with Conway, they are acquiring the future return stream of the organization that makes and manages those investments, and yes, of course, there is a lot of risk around losing the people, so these deals generally come with lockups of one kind or another (payment in restricted stock grants, generally).  This is partly why people at investment firms are paid so lavishly.", "link": "item?id=3196468", "user": "SureTheyDo"}, {"comment": "This, in my opinion, is how one manages to do what they love.", "link": "item?id=3178672", "user": "PLejeck"}, {"comment": "A minor observation corroborating your hypothesis is looking at how many people Google's accumulated from the old Bell Labs (Rob Pike, Ken Thompson, etc.).

Their defense was that the end justified the means.\"<p>Putting this into context, this wouldn't have been the first step. This type of measure was typically implemented after it becomes increasingly clear that Yahoo would not, or could not, adopt measures to reduce the amount of spam coming from their mail servers.<p>One of Yahoo's general weaknesses is that it takes over 24 hours from sending a complaint until appropriate action is taken (that's why comments on their main sites - e.g. News - contains oodles of spam, and other types of abusive comments). On the typical life-cycle of email spam this is far too long - if a site is ever closed at that point, and so these abusive sites tend to still be up when the email recipient is clicking on those links. Closing a site after the damage has been done is just a never-ending game of whack-a-mole.<p>Blackholing bigger and bigger chunks of Yahoo Stores is then an escalating step until either Yahoo addresses the spam situation appropriately, or their customers see that Yahoo cannot sustainably provide the service customers are paying for and they either leave or seek legal remedies. At that point innocent customers are paying the price for living in a bad neighbourhood. The question is, why didn't Yahoo do a better job in controlling the level of abuse through Yahoo stores? That Spamhaus felt it necessary to escalate through to blocking chunks of ip addresses indicates Yahoo Stores fell significantly short of what was needed to reduce the spam coming from their servers. The indicative belief from the anti-spam community at that point is: it's mostly clear that the revenue generated from hosting spammers is more important to Yahoo Stores than being able to provide their innocent customers with the level of service they paid for.<p>From my perspective, SpamHaus were one of the cleaner, more diplomatic black lists around the time of the Yahoo Stores problem. It's been a few years since I last poked around in the anti-spam community.

These would become supervoters, and their votes would confer or remove some multiple of karma for each up- or down-vote.  In so doing, they would exert a proportionally larger influence on the visibility of comments, hopefully helping to highlight good ones and bury bad ones.<p>The supervoter bit would not be static; it could be gained or lost.  A supervoter whose submitted comments received net negative votes by other supervoters would lose their bit, as would one who consistently voted against the trend established by the other supervoters.  Similarly, a non-supervoter who tended to submit and upvote comments that were favoured by existing supervoters and downvote comments that were buried by supervoters (before they had been greyed out, to avoid gaming) could, after a certain threshold, have their bits flipped as well.<p>Ideally, this process would be entirely transparent, with no one but yourself and other similarly privileged users able to see who had the bit.  Similarly, it would be best if the change went unannounced.  I'm aware that HN is OSS; perhaps it would be better to leave this out of that repo as reddit does with anti-spam measures.  The reason for the secrecy is the same as that for hiding karma scores: it reduces karmawhoring and gaming.<p>As for submissions, I think the problem there is both less severe and easier to solve.  HN's front page is still slow enough that it can be hand-curated.  More mods would likely be able to keep a handle on things.  However, an algorithmic solution could work.  Similar to supervoters, have superflaggers: if the ratio of submissions someone flags to those removed is high enough, flip a superflagger bit in their profile.  Then, any article in the new queue that was flagged by (say) 3 or more superflaggers would be automatically removed.<p>The reason I like these proposals, as well as the submission's, is that they are invisible and nobody knows if they are even operational.

That is simply not true, for several reasons:<p>1) You will never know if you are a super flagger, normal user, or ignored/penalized user.<p>2) Super flaggers gain no power to move things up or down for a specific article. They are merely there as a proxy for detecting if anyone is consistently upvoting improper articles. If the top 10% are super flaggers, the next 80% are normal users, and the bottom 10% are ignored, then that means the super flaggers will only account for 1/9th of the upvotes on average.

One person will not do much to push the honeypot threshold over the top.<p>4) It's a moving target.

Often small companies pop up who use this method until they're big enough to be noticed, and then they go back and negotiate retro-active deals.  This creates an unfair advantage for them over companies who choose to operate completely within the law.  These companies' only responsibility is to take the material down when they get caught, with no steeper penalty for repeat offenses or for building a business around this turnaround time.  Grooveshark is an example of an American company that falls into this category.<p>If you could see the number of takedown requests and repeat violations companies receive (I propose they be issued and resolved through a centralized database), it would be clear which companies exist almost exclusively to provide access to copyrighted material, or who do not place high enough priority on preventing copyright infringement.  I believe they need to be held accountable without placing the burden of pursuing civil penalties on the backs of individual or small company rights holders for whom a lawsuit is not equitable.  There should be severe penalties for companies whose infractions far outweigh the legitimate value they provide.  Those penalties should not require a class action lawsuit or the war chest of some large company.<p>Then there are companies who are just outright havens for illegal material, whether hosting it themselves or making user-shared content easy to find and access.  Most of these companies are offshore, or they are only providing links and information without providing the content itself, both of which makes it hard to pursue civil penalty.  I think there should be a clearly defined and transparent method for measuring the degree to which sites provide little value beyond access to illegal material, and those sites should be held accountable.  There has to be actionable recourse and, unfortunately, you can only pursue civil penalties from companies who are domestic (or in a participating country) or who actually profit from their actions.  In the case of sites who are not domestic or who do not generate meaningful financial gain for their illegal behavior, your only real option is to shut them down in one way or another.  If the criteria for a site being eligible for this type of action is clear, and the infraction history is transparent, I have a hard time justifying not taking action against them.  That being said, I do understand that we live in a world where rules are abused and I don't understand everything I need to about how such rules would be enforced.  But I don't think the the fact that it's difficult and not foolproof are good enough reasons not to pursue a better system.<p>The DMCA has put the burden of policing copyright on the shoulders of rights holders and that's fine, but penalizing companies who commit massive infringement should not be the job of a bunch of small artists and independent companies.  Then there are companies for whom the option of legal recourse is not an option, and those people should be handled in the strictest way possible without putting too much power in the hands of arbitrary organizations.", "link": "item?id=3390041", "user": "earbitscom"}], "children": [{"number": 14, "names": "pg", "comments": [{"comment": "This is why I don't understand the anti-promotion crowd who think promoting oneself and building an audience is a bad thing.

If given the ability to view karma scores, I would leave them off, since I'm self-aware enough to realize that -- when karma scores are enabled -- my comments are of a lower caliber.<p>However, I'm not against allowing users with a certain level of karma the choice to view karma scores on threads if they really feel that HN is better with karma on, which it seems like a fairly large subset of users (or at least a significantly vocal one) wish for. I think that StackOverflow's successful moderation policies (and, to a lesser extent, HNs own) have sufficiently demonstrated that extraordinary members of a community can handle the responsibilities that come with increased privilege.<p>For example, I suspect that, if pg allowed individuals with high karma, such as yourself, to choose to toggle an option such as \"view karma scores\", no flood of dumb comments from high karma individuals would suddenly manifest. Further, I think that the transition from default karma displayed to our current situation has allowed anyone who has invested significant time in the community an opportunity for introspection that wasn't previously available. I'm now able to evaluate, personally, how my comments and behavior were effected by the display of karma and I'm less susceptible to the psychological effects as a result.<p>Of course, even if there isn't a significant negative aspect to allowing high karma individuals to view karma scores, it's still hardly worthwhile unless there's some kind of positive impact as a result. Perhaps mollifying the community would be enough of a benefit? Maybe a more pro show-karma individual would be better qualified to comment on the potential upside. My feeling is that it's possible that some subset of HNers exist whose experience with the community is improved by having karma scores enabled and, as such, it would be beneficial to allow them the possibility of a choice.<p>P.S.

But I WAS being critical:  PG's description amounted to saying that VCs want to get on the plane only after it has already left the runway.  Although I didn't say it, I suspect that, then, what PG is saying is not all that close to how VC funding works.  I wasn't being critical about it being \"super hard\" to get funding but just about the apparent contradiction in what PG wrote.<p>The VCs can do what they want.  As Mark Suster has illustrated with some graphs and data, over the past 10 years the VCs have been doing poorly, and about half the partners are 'unemployed' as VCs.<p>So, I can't 'look up' to the VCs as business experts.  They have MBAs; pseudo-great, I've been an MBA prof.  Some VCs have had some startup experience, maybe in 'biz dev'.  Pseudo-great;  I helped start one of the most successful VC funded companies in history.  And as IT experts, I have to look down on nearly all of VCs (although YC is an exception) so far I'd need a Hubble telescope to tell them apart.  I've taught computing in two research universities, published peer-reviewed original research in computer science, mathematical statistics, applied mathematics, and artificial intelligence, and helped ship two commercial products from Yorktown Heights.<p>Any way it goes, I have to build a successful business.  So does every entrepreneur on Main Street who opens a pizza shop, auto body shop, grass mowing service, etc.<p>So, as you wrote, by the time I've built a successful business, say not an \"unproven\" business, I would be able to sell a fraction to a VC.  Okay.  Just why I'd want to do that escapes me.<p>Or, the day before I take a VC check I have a 'proven' business, say, half filling 15 Mbps upload bandwidth with revenue close to $300 K a month and own 100% of it.  The day after I take a VC seed check, I have $100 K -- $500 K more cash in the bank, that is, revenue from 1-2 months, where it took me much longer than 2 months to get the seed check, own none of my company, have to get my fraction of 'my' company back on a four year 'vesting' schedule, and can be fired by the Board at any time.  Bummer.<p>My point is not that it's tough to get VC funding.  Indeed, I MUST build a successful business, VC funding or bootstrapped.  It's plenty clear, from what PG wrote and more, that once I've built a successful business, say, $300 K a month in revenue growing quickly, then I could get a VC check.  And PG is saying that much before then, I can't get a VC check.  Okay.  Thems are the rules.  Good to know the rules.<p>So, what was my point?  Just that the rules as PG wrote them don't make much sense.  I doubt that what he wrote is very close to the truth.<p>As an entrepreneur, I have to evaluate the potential of my business early on.  Nowhere did PG mention that a VC will review that evaluation.  Here he is mostly correct:  One could count with shoes on all the VCs in the country who could evaluate or even direct the evaluation of the crucial, core 'secret sauce' in an IT business plan.<p>People have mentioned a similar point before:  If VCs want to wait until there is significant traction growing quickly, now they risk waiting too long.  That is, it used to be that, to get the traction, the company needed funding to write the software.  Surprise:  At least from Microsoft, once one understands the relevant parts of .NET, essentially all the code for a Web site, indeed, for much of commercial software, is already written, and all that's needed it a little, simple glue to join the .NET code.<p>Next, surprise:  If usage grows, then can call up, say, Tiger Direct, get some parts, and plug together one heck of a 64 bit server for less than $1000.  We're talking what, 4 AMD cores at 3.0 GHz for $100?  A motherboard for $100?  Main memory at $10 per GB?  2 TB hard drives for $100 each?  A high end Antec power supply for $100?  A case for $50?  Some fans for $2 or so each?  What'd I leave out?<p>Next, surprise:  If usage is significant, just $1 CPM will throw off enough cash to buy servers enough to double capacity in less than two weeks.  So, that's exponential growth.  Bandwidth used to be really expensive.  Surprise:  Now where I live $15 Mbps upload with a static IP address costs $65 a month, and CAN use it for a Web site.<p>Fred Wilson has written on his blog that these changes are good for VCs.  Maybe.  And I continue to see the major successes taking VC funding and don't have a good list of successful bootstrapped companies.<p>Still, from what PG wrote, basically I've got to have, say, $300 K a month in revenue, growing quickly, to qualify for a Series A.  But, in my case, that's just me and my team, two of whom have four legs, long tails, and long whiskers, and myself and I and a server at my left knee in my living room.  For the server, I have one in a box in the next room.  I also have an offer of a loan of one with 32 cores and 2 TB of main memory -- that used to be a lot of disk; now it's main memory!  BELEIVE me, a 32 core server could send well over 35 pages a second from my Web site software!  For the Microsoft software, their BizSpark program will let me, or essentially any IT startup, have the copies of Windows Server and SQL Server for free for a while.<p>Again, I'm not complaining that getting a VC check is too hard.  Indeed, again, I need to build a successful business, say, $300 K a month growing quickly by myself.  And, apparently PG would agree that with such a business I could get a VC check.  Okay.  But why then would I want to take a VC check?<p>Net, if I can ramp up to $300 K a month in revenue, I won't need a VC check.  If I can't, I can't get a VC check.  So, either way, there's no VC check.  So, my point is, with PGs description, of what use are the VCs?

Examples include the early months of YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.  So, they had a lot of 'unique eyeballs' per month, and the assumption was that there should be a way, somehow, to 'monitize' that.  Maybe.  Usually.<p>In my case, a lot of eyeballs mean a lot of Web pages served and, for my Web pages, a lot of ads displayed.  Then a lot of eyeballs mean a lot of revenue and, in my case, nearly all that revenue pre-tax earnings.  Or, yes, I thought of 'monitization' up front.  My most important Web pages have been carefully designed to have a banner ad of 720 x 90 pixels across the top and some number of ads 300 x 250 pixels down the right side.

No, what they did was just sell a huge chunk of their business and put themselves under the control of a VC Board under some really bad terms.  I won't suck up to VCs.<p>Entrepreneurs, including in IT, and on HN, need simply to observe that the US, border to border, is just awash in entrepreneurs who start successful businesses on Main Street with no contact with VCs.  The people I've seen in yacht clubs were mostly successful on Main Street, and there wasn't a penny of VC equity in sight.<p>My mention of a pizza shop is dead on the center of the target:  Now a Web site serving a few dozen Web pages a second takes much less in capital equipment to get started than a pizza shop.  And the Web site has some advantages, e.g., once the site is up, mostly just lean back and let the servers do the work, 24 x 7, and that beats the heck out of all the food handling, kitchen cleaning, floor washing, worker supervising, customer interactions, etc. at a pizza shop.<p>I and likely nearly all of us have neighbors in big truck, little truck businesses, fast food, gas stations, rental property, various trades, etc.  They make it, buy houses and new cars, get their kids through college, etc. without a big failure rate and without VC.  A Web site can be a better business, still.<p>Since on average, as reported by Mark Suster, VCs are not making much if any money, I have more respect as businessmen for a guy running a pizza shop, especially a guy running several, than I do for VCs.<p>For technical expertise, maybe in all the US a dozen IT VCs have some significant technical qualifications, and otherwise they would be at best just dead weight in an IT startup.  So I can't respect VCs technically either.  VCs commonly have a LOT of trouble handling their e-mail; NOT good.  VCs commonly want others, lawyers, CEOs, bankers, etc., to 'filter' entrepreneurs for them; NOT good.  VCs commonly assert that they have wide 'networks' -- mostly not among well qualified technical people!  Nearly none of the VCs are anything like the people I respected in math and physics in school or like the people I respected, say, at Yorktown Heights.<p>VCs need entrepreneurs more than entrepreneurs need VCs.  So, I'm not here to suck up to VCs.  For what PG wrote, I call BS.  So be it.  There's nothing wrong with that.

This is one of the reasons you so frequently saw IBs and other similar firms so anxious to sell themselves in the 90s, and it was, in fact, the primary driver behind the notoriously secretive Goldman Sachs going public: they had people rejecting partnership because losses made it unattractive, and their capital base was too unstable to compete in the global big leagues when it was just partners).<p>That said, Heller was cobbled together through a series of acquisitions, most notably for the HN audience, the famed Venture Law Group.  And it's not like this was all terrible, the firm lasted for well over 100 years.<p>Similarly, people have acquired real estate brokerage firms, where you'd think there'd be even _less_ of value to acquire, but they do it profitably.  I think Cendant  paid like $50m for Corcoran Group.  Organizing people and assembling clients is difficult: if you can buy an organized group of people with an active customer list/market position...there is <i>some</i> value there, it's just not going to be at sales/earnings multiples we are used to seeing with companies that own technologies.", "link": "item?id=3193987", "user": "SureTheyDo"}, {"comment": "yes, but management and insiders make money as always", "link": "item?id=3157780", "user": "eurohacker"}], "children": [{"number": 1, "names": "fleitz", "comments": [{"comment": "I'll bite, but you won't like the answer: when it gets to zero.<p>Unless you know someone willing to pay people to take their stock?", "link": "item?id=3106093", "user": "fleitz"}], "children": [{"number": 1, "names": "cperciva", "comments": [{"comment": "I'm pretty sure I've seen people here saying that they would pay for YC to take some of their stock.", "link": "item?id=3106221", "user": "cperciva"}], "children": null}]}, {"number": 1, "names": "startupcto", "comments": [{"comment": "Yea I would do that too.", "link": "item?id=3105809", "user": "startupcto"}], "children": null}]}, {"number": 2, "names": "ridiculous", "comments": [{"comment": "But famous Hollywood studios do get acquired, making that an odd analogy.

In fact, such policies where quite consciously implemented after WWII even in countries that did not see large scale destruction, because the consensus was that returning soldiers needed to be given employment to avoid social problems.<p>Unfortunately, low unemployment meant better bargaining positions for workers, and so getting rid of this \"problem\" was quite openly discussed for some time (this was documented in a PhD thesis, <a href=\"http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=11941\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=11941</a>).

This reduced the number of farmers needed as a proportion of the population, so if the population were the same as in 1100, the 5000 jobs we had before might have dropped, perhaps to 2000 jobs, or rather, food prices would have dropped so that lots of people no longer saw farming as the best idea.  However, the population had increased greatly.  My hypothesis here is that the number of jobs that could have been productively filled was still higher than the population.<p>This process can't continue forever.  Sooner or later, the number of jobs simply crosses over the number of people looking for work.  In history, I can imagine a leader, seeing lots of able bodied, desperate, and incredibly cheap manpower seeing an opportunity to raise an army and attempting to expand their own wealth by expanding their lands.  That was a natural brake on the population line.  Today, thankfully, we don't have any mechanisms that drastically reduce the population whenever people get desperate, there isn't wide areas of undeveloped land that can absorb as many people as we have over above the jobs line, and technology continues to increase productivity at a respectable rate.<p>So that is how I explain why the jobs line can cross over the population line now, and why we may now be in a situation where we might expect to have less jobs than people who want jobs for a long time.", "link": "item?id=2854656", "user": "justin_vanw"}, {"comment": "I don't believe the problem is economic inequality.

Your \"job\" is in the field by your house.<p>1700 AD: agricultural revolution. Technology allows smaller number to produce food.  This allows industrial revolution. More specifically, this creates surplus food which means people can <i>move</i>. And so jobs can move. But it also means that areas that cannot produce food competitively no longer have to. Surplus food allows jobs to move to where the water wheels and resources are to commence industrialization.<p>1800 AD: The invention of the steam engine frees jobs from the need to be near flowing water: i.e. to move to where the resources are, or where the need to be. For much of the UK this was near ports as raw materials (e.g. cotton) came by ship. Bonus if the port is near a coal field. Again, areas that do not have cheap access to transport and coal, no longer have jobs.<p>1970 AD: Oil, giant ships, containerization and \"free\" trade allows jobs to move where wages are cheaper. Entire <i>nations</i> are uncompetitive at manufacturing.<p>2005 AD: Communications revolution. International calls are free. Service industry jobs move to where wages are cheaper.

Nike finally stops using child labor.<p>What is left for humans?<p><i>Technology has been killing (but not net killing) jobs for centuries.</i><p>Is this true? Or is it the case that as technology kills jobs, the unemployed find make work? That is, even if the unemployment level in a country has stayed the same, does it mean that the new jobs that the displaced workers perform are useful, or just a drain on society? Sure in the 19th century there were new non-make-work jobs. But today? Example: people working at Hallmark stores. Example: layer upon layer of middle and upper management. Perhaps it doesn't matter: if society can support make-work jobs, because of efficiencies elsewhere, then as long as people are employed it doesn't matter how. The problem would be if those make-work jobs could no longer be supported. This is what is happening: it is not in China's interest any more to support the vast inefficiencies of the US economic system. Make-work jobs are going away.<p>Finally, WWII: we destroyed most of the world economy to the point where the US <i>was</i> the world economy (ok, 75% of it). Does this have anything to do with the US having full employment (i.e. hiding technology's job kill) - and if so, now that the rest of the world has caught up, might we now see that the US economy cant support the make-work jobs?", "link": "item?id=2855224", "user": "ldar15"}], "children": null}, {"number": 1, "names": "moe", "comments": [{"comment": "<i>why now?</i><p>Because technology != technology.", "link": "item?id=2852193", "user": "moe"}], "children": null}, {"number": 1, "names": "xal", "comments": [{"comment": "Read \"lights in the tunnel\" by Martin Ford.", "link": "item?id=2852139", "user": "xal"}], "children": null}, {"number": 1, "names": "bulletsvshumans", "comments": [{"comment": "Perhaps it's not because of technological change per se, but an increasing rate of technological change.
