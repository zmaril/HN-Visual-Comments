If this thread goes like these kinds of threads usually go on Hacker News, I have no doubt you will have helped quite a few others with this. And hopefully, you will get help too. But that won't be easy. Here's why...<p>When I read your headline on the front page, the first thing I thought was, \"OK, someone to help and encourage. Good.\" After I read your comment, I didn't feel quite the same way.<p>I normally try to be upbeat and positive, but in your case, it won't sound that way. I'm going to give it to you straight and I hope that you don't get offended or upset. You need feedback from my point of view.<p>It's perfectly normal for someone to be weak technically or with other people. It's perfectly normal for someone to struggle with work habits, project management, or personal issues. It's also perfectly normal for excellent people to have been fired. Many of us have been on both sides of these issues.<p>And these are the kinds of things that are easily managed and fixed.<p>Your issues, unfortunately, run deeper. Conflicts with bosses? OK, we've all been there. Not getting along? That happens, too. A negative assessment of your boss? Whoa. That would piss me off, too. Why didn't you just talk to him? Refusing to work on a project? WTF? That's your fucking job!<p>These are the kinds of things that are <i>not</i> easily managed and fixed. I don't know why anyone would take a chance on someone with this kind of track performance. I know that I wouldn't. I'd much rather hire a weak performer with good attitude and potential than a strong performer with interpersonal issues you describe. It's just not worth the trouble.<p>You most telling remark, however, was:<p><i>Another obstacle is that I'm an introvert loner and hence just the opposite of the \"communicative teamplayer\" companies seem to be looking for.</i><p>As one introvert loner to another, I can confidently tell you that this is just an excuse. Almost all of us are introvert loners and almost all employers want \"communicative teamplayers\". And most of us just find a way to make it work.<p>I bet I've been in situations like yours (and worse) far more times than you and I bet many others here have too. I've been abused more ways than I care to remember. I've done the work of 5 people and been passed up for promotion. I've worked overtime for years and got no credit. I've been yelled at, cussed at, and many times, generally treated like shit. But I've learned how to put up with it until it's no longer time to put up with it. It all depends where you draw the line.<p>I've never had words with a boss or customer. I've never emailed, talked about someone else, or filled out any form about them without <i>talking to them first</i>. And most of all, I've <i>never refused work</i>. That's our reason for being there in the first place.<p><i>Any ideas on how to get back into the working world with such a track record?</i><p>I may sound negative, but believe me, I really want to help. So here are a few thoughts:<p>1. The root cause of your negative experiences is probably still there. You need to identify that cause, understand your role, and fix it. Get help with that if you think you need it. The good news: you know there's a problem and you're already talking about it. You may be 90% of the way there.<p>2. Always tell the truth.<p>3. Don't be afraid to admit that you may have been wrong.<p>4. Be prepared to describe your experiences (truthfully always!) and what steps you have already taken to grow because of them.<p>5. Don't volunteer (in writing or in person) anything that you don't have to that can potentially hurt you.<p>6. <i>Never</i> give references until <i>after</i> you have a job offer (contingent upon those references).<p>7. Find a way to have a positive attitude and make it show.<p>8. Understand that there are assholes everywhere and you will surely encounter many more. You can't control them. But you must control yourself. Don't let them fuck you up any more.<p>I hope I haven't been too tough, but I think you needed to hear this.

In no particular order:<p><i>I kinda knew it was going to happen</i><p>What? That's a horrible attitude and probably a self-fulfilling prophesy. I know of many cases (mine included) where everything was \"perfect\", world-changing idea, solid team, great skill, intense passion, practically a perfect alignment of the stars, and it <i>still failed</i>. Software is hard! Startups are harder! You will probably fail anyway, so if you attitude isn't 100%, then you should save yourselves and everyone else a lot of trouble and not even bother.<p><i>truly believed that my current startup had potential to grow</i><p>See my remarks above. You may have been right about your startup's potential and still failed. This is normal!<p><i>I lost the one chance I had</i><p>This is ridiculous so just get it out of your head. We all get <i>many</i> chances. Many successful entrepreneurs failed (several times) before they succeeded.<p><i>Given that we didn't have any programming or design experience</i><p>Then I'm not surprised you failed. Those of us with lots of experience, myself included, are constantly encouraging those with little or no experience to pursue building virtual stuff. It's a wonderful avocation with great opportunity for career satisfaction. But please don't mistake encouragement for approval. You will have to pay your dues first. Sure, it's much easier to come up to speed quickly now than it used to be, but you still have to get <i>something</i> under your belt before you can build good stuff. Like I said earlier, it's tough enough for the best of us to succeed with a startup; by definition, it's tougher for you.<p><i>One of the startup advice that I hear most often is to create a product that solves a problem of your own (37signals) because there's bound to be people like you who have the same problem.</i><p>There's no guarantee of that. Worse, lots of others may be thinking the same thing, so we end up with lots of teams building the same useless thing that they all want but no one else does. Or others may want, but not badly enough to pay. It's interesting advice that has been effective for some people, but frankly, I've never liked it. As a natural outlier, I would <i>never</i> build something that I want. For me, that's just a recipe for failure. I'd much rather pound the pavement and find out what others want and are willing to pay for.<p>Please take this advice, like all advice on Hacker News, 37 Signals, or anywhere else with a grain of salt. Our industry is still in its infancy so there are few rules yet, just lots of guidelines. One of the best skills you can have now is to be able to distinguinguish between which advice is good or bad <i>for you</i>.<p><i>we sacrificed all the time we had with friends, family, and ignored our relationships for the most part</i><p>First of all, that's a bad attitude. Life is a zero-sum game, so by definition, you can't have it all. Using the word \"sacrificed\" to describe the thing you choose not to have is problematic. You chose A and didn't choose B. Fine. But you sacrificed nothing. In fact, you're probably way ahead. You learned stuff that most others never do, and the people who really matter are still there. By definition, you can't possibly lose real friends by living your life the way you choose. Anyone you lost was never really a friend in the first place.<p><i>It was miserable and lonely</i><p>Then you're in the wrong business. I spend 90% of my time alone with my computer and I love it! I have figured out how to balance work and life, but make no mistake about it, if you choose to be a programmer, and especially if you choose to start a startup, you will be alone with your ones a zeros a lot. If that doesn't absolutely turn you on, then maybe you should consider doing something else.<p><i>still dreaming of get rich quick schemes</i><p>Fuck. That. Shit.<p>If you're doing this to get rich, then please just stop and go do something else. Law school, medical school, Wall Street, selling ebooks, whatever.<p>I know it sounds counter-intuitive, but in order to succeed with software (and software startups), you must focus on many more things before money. First, you must absolutely love what you do. If you don't, then you will end up writing posts like yours. Then you must have an undying determination to build that which must be built (according to you). Anything less is a sure recipe for failure.<p>Sure, lots of us get rich but many more don't. And those that do often observe that even though they did the absolute best that they could, the real riches came from sources beyond their control: they got lucky or were in the right place at the right time.<p>There are lots of great reasons for building the stuff we build. IMHO, \"getting rich\" is not one of them.<p><i>That was the key- it would really tackle the problem of not being able to meet people and just socialize</i><p>It sounds like you may have gotten feedback in an echo chamber; that is, you talked to alot of similar people so you <i>thought</i> you had a random sample but really didn't.

So I have a great deal of confidence in my ability to build stuff. But here's the rub: most of the technologies I know so well are old (some may even say obsolete).

I am your poster boy who lives \"cheap\" and not \"frugal\" by choice.  I clip coupons and browse slickdeals before committing to a purchase.  I never buy anything at MSRP.  I monitor airfare prices for weeks before booking a ticket.<p>This is a difficult problem to escape because it's one that <i>I behaved myself into</i>, and that it's self-reinforcing for a variety of reasons:<p>- When you're already on a fixed salary, the opportunity cost of spending time on being cheap is not obvious.  You're not taking time away from that $500/hr side consulting gig that you don't have.  Instead, you're at a situation where the marginal rate of return on clipping coupons (say, $10/hr) is significantly better than spending the next hour working on that iPhone app that is months from release and has no interested buyers (how long is it going to take to recoup the Apple developer fee?).<p>- Some people get a rush out of saving money, a feeling of <i>\"Ha! I beat the system.\"</i>  To them, saving money is a form of entertainment [1], and there's certainly far worse hobbies to have from a well-being perspective.  Unfortunately, there are people who take this too far and end up as total misers or compulsive hoarders.  I'm not a pathological case, but I've done things that would make some people cringe.<p>- Seeing people successfully live frugally can be a motivator to follow in their path.  My parents are immigrants who worked hard and saved for 20 years before they were finally able to afford a house in an expensive neighborhood (and nearly paid for it all in cash).  They drive Toyotas, shop at Costco, and cook at home.  They are basically the epitome of the \"millionaire next door\" [2].<p>- There's also a moral justification for this.  <i>\"Why do I have to keep up with my spendthrift neighbors?  So what if I don't drive a Maserati or carry a Herm\u00e8s bag?  No thanks, I shall be comfortable in my own skin, since envy and greed are evil.\"</i>  This is now an identity statement [3], and while it's a good position to take from a financial perspective, it can be crippling in the way it makes some people closed-minded.  Of course, this doesn't necessarily stop them from pontificating about retirement at 30.<p>I do still think that my years of being cheap are starting to pay off, mostly because I'm finally getting comfortable with the sort of \"discretionary\" expenses you mentioned in your post.  The difference is that it probably took a much larger bank balance for me to consider them \"affordable.\"  I just flew across the continent purely on a whim to visit some friends that I hadn't seen in years, I no longer cringe at expensive bar tabs if they were time well spent with buddies, I can afford to make an impulse electronics purchase just to see what it's like, and I'm preparing for that self-funded sabbatical [4] to reboot my life.<p>Was it worth it?  Well, it was really, really hard to re-orient myself this way, and it took much more sacrifice than necessary, but the good news is that aside from lost time, most of the rest hopefully can be recovered.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/2009/08/saving-money-trumps-sex/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/2009/08/saving-money-trumps-se...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Thomas-Stanley/dp/0671015206\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Millionaire-Next-Door-Thomas-Stanley/d...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000076.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000076.html</a>", "link": "item?id=3117780", "user": "CoreDumpling"}, {"comment": "My trick for getting unstuck is to start maintenance on the part where I'm stuck.

When there are information asymmetries or actors attempting to impose inefficiencies in a market, supply and demand breaks badly.<p>To quote one of Joel's best posts:<p><i>Software is priced three ways: free, cheap, and dear.</i><p><i>1. Free. Open source, etc. Not relevant to the current discussion. Nothing to see here. Move along.</i><p><i>2. Cheap. $10 - $1000, sold to a very large number of people at a low price without a salesforce. Most shrinkwrapped consumer and small business software falls into this category.</i><p><i>3. Dear. $75,000 - $1,000,000, sold to a handful of rich big companies using a team of slick salespeople that do six months of intense PowerPoint just to get one goddamn sale. The Oracle model.</i><p><i>All three methods work fine.</i><p><i>Notice the gap? There's no software priced between $1000 and $75,000. I'll tell you why. The minute you charge more than $1000 you need to get serious corporate signoffs. You need a line item in their budget. You need purchasing managers and CEO approval and competitive bids and paperwork. So you need to send a salesperson out to the customer to do PowerPoint, with his airfare, golf course memberships, and $19.95 porn movies at the Ritz Carlton. And with all this, the cost of making one successful sale is going to average about $50,000. If you're sending salespeople out to customers and charging less than $75,000, you're losing money.</i><p><a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckie...</a><p>With behaviour like that, supply and demand is absolutely the least important factor in making certain B2B sales. Doubling the supply of \"dearly priced\" software can't drive the price below $75,000 because it costs $50,000 to make a sale. What's interesting is the opportunity to innovate to make the jump from \"dear\" to \"cheap.\" That's a business model problem, not a supply problem.

If debugging in the cloud is hard enough, then maybe overbearing type systems are the lesser of two hassles.<p>* Interactive programming is a big win. One of the best things about Lisp is the REPL, and how well-integrated it is with the editor. (At least, if you use something like SLIME.) If I'm programming on a distributed system, I definitely want to be able to quickly test out my code, preferably in a concurrent environment. You could solve this by having a bunch of servers for this, or with some fancy simulation environment, or a bunch of virtual machines, or something. The point is, I want errors to show up fast.<p>* Really good log analysis. Ideally, any framework you're using would automatically log everything it does, and then you would use some nice tools to figure out what happened, and where it went wrong. Maybe the Loggly guys will come up with some good stuff.<p>* Data-flow oriented abstractions like what Apache Pig offers. Pig lets you define a directed acyclic dataflow graph, in which each edge is some operation like \"group by field x\", or \"filter by function f(fields)\".

They're done. Maybe they're okay as a savings vehicle (maybe!), but you should not realistically expect to make more than 2-3% returns after accounting for inflation, fees, taxes, and time spent on them. And, no, you're not going to be able to consistently outperform people who specialize full time in those kinds of investments and who have access to insider information.<p>The real trick is to invest in something you do have access to insider information about and that you do do full time: being yourself. Invest in human capital, aside from a financial baseline to diversify for when your human capital starts to rapidly depreciate.<p>In some ways this is cheap. Reject certifications besides the most basic (a degree). Focus on getting an education instead. Buying a top of the line computer, high speed internet access, and books to learn from, for developers, is an almost negligible expense that will go a long way. And the most valuable way to learn--creating useful projects--can more than pay for themselves.<p>In other ways this is expensive, though. Choosing to invest in a 401k* takes an hour or two of your life per year, while investing in yourself is at least one or two hours a day. This is very, very expensive if you're already spending 50 hours a week sitting at a computer pounding away at brain-deadening code. (On the other hand, if you can get paid while also increasing your human capital... you've hit gold. Stay there until you've stopped rapidly learning, and then jump to the next big thing.)<p>Key point, though: there are multiple areas you have to invest in. Yes, a professional skill like coding is useful. But who knows what it'll be like in 5 or 10 years? Make sure to put time into your relationships, your physical health, your non-coding hobbies (drawing, banjo, typography, whatever). This diversification exposes you to more long-term investments: they help you maximize your luck surface area and will come in handy surprisingly frequently down the line.<p>How do all these retire-at-30 articles fit in? They aim to maximize financial investments early on by under-investing in many categories of self-capital, hopefully catching a good bull market, and rapidly switching to building self capital at 30. The obvious flaw is the assumption of outsized returns--they're not going to be as big as hoped--but that can be dealt with by tinkering with the numbers a bit.<p>The more fundamental issue is that it's not diversifying. It's risky. If you've saved up 500k by 30 by working long hours and frugally cutting coupons on your time off, that's nice, and if things work out right you might be fine. But suppose the defaulting of some government thousands of miles away sets off a chain reaction of bank failures that ends up massively contracting the economy you live in. There goes most of your savings. Yes, you might have invested in bonds, but you wouldn't have been pulling in those massive returns you were banking on to retire so early. And your job, having been funded by massive amounts of loose capital, suddenly disappears. Oh, you're farked, and you'll have to start nearly from scratch again after the economy recovers. Back to giving up your weekends to the whims of an MBA. (If anyone's willing to hire an expensive 35-year-old developer when there are all these recent college grads willing to work like dogs so they can retire at 30.)<p>Or even simpler: you hand in your resignation on your 30th birthday, walk out the door, and are hit by a semi driven by some overworked and drugged up trucker. Wow, that sucks. At least all those hard-earned dollars will go to some charity or another.<p>The ideal, I think, is to semi-retire as soon as you can, and work 15 to 20 hours a week at jobs you find interesting or fun. You get the best of both worlds and have diluted the amount of risk you face at any one time.<p>*Controversial statement here: 401k's are the biggest scam alive today, you're not only freezing your capital but also betting on taxes being lower in the future than they are today.", "link": "item?id=3118001", "user": "scarmig"}, {"comment": "Chicago is like layover country though, right?", "link": "item?id=3133736", "user": "zachrose"}, {"comment": "I thought that edw519 was actually talking about incremental rewriting, i.e. refactoring.", "link": "item?id=2717826", "user": "eru"}, {"comment": "<i>[empathy] is the number one trait I manage for.

In short:<p>Bodily awareness -&#62; emotional self-awareness -&#62; emotional other-awareness (empathy) -&#62; effective communication -&#62; healthy relationships -&#62; happiness.<p>It turns out that your brain uses the same machinery to model your own emotional state as that which it uses to model the emotional states of others, so the better you are at identifying your own emotional states, the better you will be at identifying them in others, which will allow you to communicate more effectively and so forth.<p>Also relevant: Asana's Jack Stahl touches on the importance of empathy in a post post about peer feedback at work: <a href=\"http://asana.com/2011/06/peer-feedback-at-asana/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://asana.com/2011/06/peer-feedback-at-asana/</a>", "link": "item?id=2760658", "user": "pkghost"}, {"comment": "You bring up something I failed to mention: this can be a touchy situation.

That, and stories posted at a rate of one or two a day. Sites like Slashdot/HN/reddit are instead mainly based around discussing offsite links, which K5 allowed but sort of discouraged as \"mindless link propagation\" (there was a section for it, but people didn't want too many submissions to it, and you typically had to add some substantive commentary to the link to get the submission accepted). The articles were also directly written for / targeted to the K5 community. People do sometimes write blog posts specifically to target HN, but they're often more multitargeted--- stuff submitted here might not be written with an HN audience in mind at all, or HN might only be one of several intended audiences.<p>Some classic Usenet groups were sort-of in that style as well. You <i>could</i> start a new thread with a one-line post or \"what do you think of this?\" query, but some groups had a culture of starting new threads only when you had a significant, well-thought out post to make; otherwise you were supposed to stick to existing threads.<p>I'm afraid it's harder to attract good content to a community these days, though. The people who used to consistently write good stuff for Kuro5hin now have their own blogs, and post their content there instead. In the early 2000s, it was a win-win situation: Kuro5hin provided an outlet for people who had things to say, and people who had things to say provided interesting content to read and discuss.

The same problems came forth until such a point that the existing communities had assimilated the newbies and by October or November things had returned to where they were, just a bit bigger.<p>Then along came AOL, giving out free/cheap internet access to all and lowering the technical barrier to getting on-line. A good thing for the world, but a bad thing for those Usenet communities who suddenly had to assimilate an influx greater than a normal September, and also an influx that didn't subside. At some point the ability of those in Usenet to assimilate was surpassed by the people getting on-line and finding Usenet. The term \"Eternal September\" was coined to describe this problem and the general failure of Usenet to keep up with the flow and the lowering standards that are the result of this.<p>I think HackerNews has no technical problem.<p>The discussion around karma and mod points is a distraction, the same goes for invite only systems and \"classic\" view.<p>I'm going to speculate that the problem is purely the size of the population and the growth rate, and that the community gravity is now such that this is not going to stop.<p>Anyone who has been here for years, and anyone who has a shed load of karma points... those who give in time, effort... there's no questioning that we/they all want to have a place such as this, and few really want to leave it. But it's hard to see how staying is going to help, and here's why: Time is valuable to us, and our expectations have risen as our experience and knowledge increased, and we feel defeated by that influx and we sense the gravity (that if anything increases the rate of influx).<p>Due to the growth, the noise level is so much higher (even if only 0.1% of the population post new things or respond, 0.1% of hundreds of thousands rather than thousands is still a far higher noise level). How can we cut through the noise to find the good stuff (subjective to the individual) given this noise? I read the firehose (/new) in an attempt to not miss the good, but realise that I've amplified the volume of everything to try and not miss the gems.<p>The influx is such that it feels non-correctable to some degree. We can look back at the side-splitting Erlang day as a humorous attempt at a correction (which it was, but we probably didn't perceive the bigger picture then... the \"Eternal February\").<p>The thing is, most old-timers are aware there is still a lot of value in learning from new people, of passing on knowledge to new people... it's a two-way street and some good comes from growth and closing the gate isn't the desired thing. As the noise levels get higher closing the gate seems tempting, but it's silly. Shutting the gate is not going to help.<p>There is a natural contribution rate at which the noise levels are manageable, and there's a natural growth rate at which people can be assimilated such that the noise doesn't go above manageable levels. When either rate is crossed it can be difficult, when both are crossed we end up here.<p>My suggestion would be along Alex's lines... to not divide by date registered (just those with early registration dates), to not exclude by network (an invite only boys club), nor to kill HN (which still serves as a really important hub by bringing us all together, and I'm sure some would feel that anything new is a conscious threat to the old).<p>Instead we should create some thing (or multiple things) that is so much more narrowly focused that it doesn't have much appeal beyond a smallish number. That focus needs to be narrow enough that growth is naturally limited too.<p>I think that defining that 'thing' is where it gets interesting. What that narrowly focused topic is, well that is going to be different from person to person.<p>It's likely that many small communities would spring up; maybe one focused on devops + computer science (a bit like the ACM SIGACTS-SIGOPS), maybe one focused on purely the business side of startups, etc.<p>HN is rare because it encompasses all of these, but I'd suggest it may be better to not be so far encompassing and instead to have a set of communities (subreddits vs stack overflows vs unconnected sites) more narrowly focused and people would join subsets that interested them rather than have them all exist in a global scope (where the noise level is that of the whole set).<p>The hardest part of doing anything comes down to the people.<p>Ultimately it's the mix of people here that is so awesome, it's what acts most as gravity to those outside of the community. Having this calibre of people choose to invest in smaller communities is going to be the hardest thing when staying on just HN, or just opting out altogether, is so easy to do.<p>I too think it's time for something more focused and smaller to emerge to tackle the noise level. That this is likely to be many smaller things and that I'd miss part of the debate is kinda fine, I'm fine with missing some stuff if the standard on the bits I'm more strongly interested in can be raised and I don't miss that stuff.", "link": "item?id=2253573", "user": "buro9"}, {"comment": "Maybe if there is so much itching going on you should make a niche site regarding skin disorders...", "link": "item?id=2252064", "user": "Klinky"}, {"comment": "For all those who downvoted this how do you 100% 'solve' spam?", "link": "item?id=2250965", "user": "icefox"}, {"comment": "Thanks to this article, I now know that it is a gigantic pain to travel internationally with the US, that TSA agents are not good at their jobs, and that people get harassed for taking pictures sometimes.

Then, people who contacted you would be contacting you with the trust score of the identity server pre-applied (you'd assign your work identity server a high score, because only employees may be members, while the meet-up score would be lower because anyone could show up and sign in, etc.) If you only want to deal with people you've physically met, you can just draw a line saying to discard messages below a certain trust score, and be done with it.<p>If not, though, channels are still a helpful complement to spam filtering, as each channel could have its own spam filter trained on channel content\u2014so something that would be perfectly fine in a \"work.offtopic\" channel would be considered spam in a \"work.ontopic\" channel.
