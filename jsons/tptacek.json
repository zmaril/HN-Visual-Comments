Why does 37signals have an office with walls made of 37signalsium (really, seen it, it's fuzzy) and trendy furniture despite selling software that the nerdosphere can clearly duplicate? Why does Yammer even consider publishing a $5/user/month price for software that is among every web geek's top-5-most-likely-personal projects?<p>Answer: they don't sell gypsum.<p>Cost based pricing, which works for gypsum sales but not so much for software, suggests that the price of a nice photo should be the price of the gas to get to and from the photo shoot, possibly divided by the number of people interested in buying the photo, plus maybe throw a couple bucks in there and buy yourself something nice, photographer.<p>Value-based pricing says, \"how much it cost me to create the photo is <i>irrelevant</i>\". YES YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES, say the nerds. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS SAYING! But value-based pricing continues: \"no, what matters is how much it would cost <i>you</i> to make that photo and how much benefit it brings\".<p>How much it would cost <i>you</i> to make that photo: (say) $6000, perhaps divided by the number of different photos you'd take given the same setup (but then also scaled back up to account for the headcount or professional services required to take lots of pictures).<p>How much benefit? It depends. I could take 10,000 words listing out factors in figuring it out. Most importantly: what are the substitutes to this photo and how much do they cost? For some businesses, clip art of the Eiffel Tower suffices to bring 80-90% of the value. For others (like ad-sales print publications), comparables might also be very expensive.<p>Now, the extent to which the YOUR business benefit from my photo exceeds MY cost to produce the photo is MY ADVANTAGE IN PRODUCING PHOTOS (the extent to which your <i>cost</i> exceeds <i>my</i> cost is my \"comparative advantage\"\u2020\u2020\u2020, and if it's a positive number possibly suggests that I'm the one who should be doing the photos in any case, since you have better ways to put your money to use). Having an advantage is a <i>good thing</i>. Among other things, it's a key reason why software startups are lucrative, and why we don't all work on line-of-business software for non-software companies.<p>It's probably true that a photo of a sunset isn't worth $6,000. But, exclusivity aside, the value of the photo also has nothing to do with how much it cost the photographer to take each shot at the margin, and it has nothing to do with the cost to make each marginal sale. What matters is how much it costs the <i>customer</i> to replace that value with a substitute, and in that analysis the $6000 set-up cost, while not determinative, is relevant perspective.<p>The moralism in these threads is an irrelevant sideshow. Situationally, the nerdosphere oscillates between extremes when trying to compute valuations for stuff with intangible-seeming benefits. Today, the nerdosphere apparently thinks either (a) every photo is a precious snowflake or (b) photo costs should be scaled by the current price of hard disk storage. Yesterday, it was whether it's right for Github to charge per repo. Before that, it's whether it's fair to have markets for spec work like 99designs.<p>None of that matters. What matters is, is there a market for what you're selling, and will it clear based on the model you use to price stuff on the market. Clearly there is a market for high-quality photography. Clearly it is not a cost-based market like gypsum, or there would not exist sites selling photos with royalties attached, or photos costing hundreds of dollars --- which clearly those sites do exist. So instead of arguing about how much photos should cost --- because, again, they cost what the market says they cost, not what you think it costs to make them yourself --- think instead about how this discussion applies to your own work product. More than you think it does, is my guess.<p>\u2020\u2020\u2020 <i>(Actually this isn't all what comparative advantage is; comparative advantage says, if there's a market for widgets and a market for photos and you're better at widgets than photos and I'm better at photos than widgets, then I should do widgets and you should do photos, which is a subtly different idea, but the point stands either way.)</i>", "link": "item?id=3453606", "user": "tptacek"}, {"comment": "It's not complicated.

The wide area discovery and \"session\" (OSI style) management roles played by IP and TCP will be played by overlay networks.

Intelligence belongs to the edges, not the core of the network; intelligence at the core is necessarily a lowest-common-denominator affair, and is hard to scale. That's a key reason why we don't have multicast today. Routers are so bad at scale that tier 1 NSPs filtered BGP announcements by prefix length, because they couldn't handle /32-granular routing for even the tiny subset of machines that actually wanted it (begging the question of how we ever expect IPv6 to do the things the typical HN reader hopes they'll do, like provide them with their own portable /16-equivalents).

Read Buffett's shareholder note after buying Burlington Northern.<p>Third, if (say) 80-90% of public transit is commuter transit, keep in mind that most US major metros have tolerably effective public transit, and many (NYC, Chicago, DC, &#38;c) have extremely good public transit.<p>While you think about that remember also that the real estate bubble and artificially low commuter costs (cheap gas, &#38;c) distorted public transit in our metro areas by encouraging the development of exurb suburbs that can't cost-effectively be addressed by rail. It's possible that within the next 20 years, they won't be cost-effective for cars either, and that problem will self-correct as housing values in exurbs plummet and families move back into the public transit rings around the cities.<p>Put differently, because maybe that point seems banal (\"suburbs bad!\"), consider that in complaining about transit, we may effectively be complaining that it is hard to link a city with what should be a corn field in the middle of nowhere. Well, yeah?<p>Then read everything everyone else writes about long distance high speed rail.<p>I'd love to have it. People made fun of STL-&#62;CHI high speed rail, hoping instead for coast-to-coast or Chicago-&#62;Detroit-&#62;Cleveland-&#62;NYC, but STL-&#62;CHI would link two major metros and allow companies to expand between the cities; for instance, it would allow us to hire out of STL and serve STL companies as house accounts.<p>But the flip side of high-speed rail is that it's simply not cost-competitive over the distances we're dealing with, especially once you factor the cost of deploying it, which is spectacular. Just look at the problems California had with secure rights of way.<p>It's easy for Europe to have effective rail, because Europe is comparatively tiny; the distance from Berlin to Rome is just a little more than twice the distance the Acela runs; Acela's got nowhere to go north of Boston, and extending it to Atlanta would make Acela longer than Berlin-Rome.", "link": "item?id=3411724", "user": "tptacek"}, {"comment": "Does your company have direct sales reps <i>at all</i>?<p>A direct sales rep has a one-on-one relationship with individual named customers and works with a marketing team to target prospects directly, and spends perhaps weeks of time (over the course of a sales cycle) with each customer.", "link": "item?id=3426542", "user": "tptacek"}, {"comment": "SOPA may have zero support on HN (it's not a well-written law) but the MPAA and RIAA have more support than you might assume.", "link": "item?id=3426504", "user": "tptacek"}, {"comment": "I have trouble with a comparison between incentive comp schemes for programmers and sales commissions.

People expect that public transportation will, when it \"works,\" be better than having their own vehicle. If driving to a destination is faster and more pleasant, then the system has failed.<p>In general, there are two problems with this. First, the system was not designed for your trip - your car is. You car will (almost) always be better than any general purpose transport system. The measure of a transport system is how many places you can get to in an acceptable time frame with acceptable reliability. Obviously, as reliability increases and the time frame shrinks, the system improves. Think about the cost of your vehicle (both up front and continuing) and multiply that by the population of your city. We pay quite a lot for the quality afforded by a private vehicle.<p>Second, I think that many people judge trips from a point of view that's heavily conditioned by experiences in private vehicles. I like taking the subway to work because it lets me read for 25-30 minutes. I like it because I don't have to pay attention and can safely think about other things while I'm traveling. Many people aren't used to the different texture of traveling with a crowd of strangers, and I think that effects their assessments of the overall system.", "link": "item?id=3411911", "user": "aeturnum"}, {"comment": "Be careful when comparing population density between Montana and Canada.

The main difference in our work is that we really latched on to VJ's idea of breadcrumbs and caching blocks. When I alluded to Bittorrent I wasn't really referring to FEC-based distribution. The problem with FEC is as you said somewhere else -- it's not very efficient for small files and it currently isn't very location aware (aside from Ono, my professor's research lab's Bittorrent plugin) so you can end up going halfway around the world for relevant pieces of the file.<p>Instead, we were more interested with the robust swarm implementations that were already present in some Bittorrent clients, like fairly efficient DHTs. It is also an already existing protocol with millions of users so we could piggyback on Bittorrent clients with plugins to measure the real performance all over the world.<p>The key difference is the caching. Jacobson proposes that the caching would happen in the ISPs, but there's no reason peers couldn't take up the slack, only different monetary incentives. The protocol here becomes less like OSPF and more like distributed k-minimum spanning tree. If you can find the \"supernodes\" then you can implement caching on their front and prevent unnecessary communication.<p>Of course, if you think anything like me your first thought is, \"do we actually know if data requests are reliably concentrated in a specific area such that local caching will actually provide much of a benefit?\" My partners thought the same thing, which is why they ended up doing a Bittorrent traffic analysis to attempt to plot an AS distribution curve for data requests[1]. They found that there was huge redundancy in intra-AS requests, so there's at least potential here.<p>Of course there are still a number of problems to be worked out -- if the supernodes don't have an easy incentive to provide caching to other people in their AS, how do we develop such an incentive? But the overall protocol seems very interesting. Most notably it would <i>not</i> work like FEC and small files would probably benefit even more from the caching (which is why you'll also note that files are split into blocks or datagrams or whatever you wish to call them in the VJ protocol).<p>[1] <a href=\"http://acm.eecs.northwestern.edu/site_media/cccp.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://acm.eecs.northwestern.edu/site_media/cccp.pdf</a><p>I really don't deserve to be on this paper -- Zach and John really ran this show.", "link": "item?id=3410662", "user": "Locke1689"}, {"comment": "<a href=\"http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~fleum/csvt.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://privatewww.essex.ac.uk/~fleum/csvt.pdf</a> for example.", "link": "item?id=3408971", "user": "eternalban"}, {"comment": "I have a hard time imagining Tim League fabricating this.

To be considered secure, a MAC function must resist existential forgery under chosen-plaintext attacks.

The general pathology when people focus on 'One Time Pads' is that they're blinded by the 'absolute security' of that one primitive, and don't think about the security properties of everything else. Breaking your hash function allows a plaintext-knowing attacker to rewrite a message, which is considered a break of your entire system. In other words, your system is only as secure as your hash function.<p>2. Since the general security of a system is contingent upon its easiest attack (even if that attack is somehow 'rarer'), you might as well use that same hash function to create a stream cipher and once again avoid the huge OTP.

While your system may indeed have stronger confidentiality properties, it most likely will have undetected implementation errors due to it not being widely scrutinized.<p>4. I think the meat of your argument is that BKD (backpack key distribution) is comparable to QKD. I do agree that your comparison is appropriate, but think it says more about QKD than BKD. Quantum key distribution still relies on classical algorithms for authenticating the classical channel (some kind of MAC), and today's QKD products even rely on classical block ciphers, as the QKD-produced keys are quite small.<p>5. I see no benefits to QKD in general. It only works between prearranged (and physically connected!) pairs of parties.

San Diego is awesome, but it's kind of an urban sprawl, not well planned. But any infrastructure would be great in that climate, right?

Downtown in Austin seems to merely represent the 'soul' of the city, while the majority of the 'residents' live in poorly planned suburbs with 1.5 Walmarts, and 3 starbucks for every 5 miles you drive in your SUV. So Austin is not a great city in my book, because of it's poor surrounding suburb infrastructure, and 'fo' downtown. Austin downtown acts more of an amusement park, than an actual great city.<p>But that does not mean Austin is not 'great', it's just not a 'great city' on an international scale, in terms of public infrastructure and the such.

It was absolutely not the case that web developers in 1995 were careful to make sure that they represented state consistently or provided discoverable resources. Then as now, most web applications (and APIs, where they existed) were black boxes with parameters defined by expediency.<p>Also, even Fielding doesn't claim that RPC interfaces are <i>wrong</i>. He seems to have a much bigger (and more reasonable) problem with people pretending that RPC interfaces are REST. There are plenty of interfaces that make just as much sense in RPC as they would in REST; it's not unlikely that there are plenty of them that make <i>more</i> sense expressed as RPC.<p>I also don't understand the emotional appeal.

REST was intended to cover the common case of the Web so that the standards themselves will be optimized to the common case.   The \"self appointed\" elite are wrong to suggest that REST <i>is</i> the Web, but to me it's just as wrong to suggest that REST doesn't provide a useful abstract model of what makes the web work.<p>Regarding CGI, yeah, it was a hack, and it worked.   But look at how website design evolved -- sometimes those websites sucked because they changed URIs all the time breaking bookmarks, search engines, etc.   These practices weren't thought of in academic terms, no, but the point is that there was a theory underlying what emergent properties made websites good and popular (stable URIs for example, which led to better search, and bookmarking), which led to mainstream aphorisms like \"cool URIs don't change\" in the 97-98 timeframe.  This was eventually codified academically in Roy's thesis a few years later.   My point is that this wasn't completely accidental, there were people actively advocating \"good practices\" in the 90s, even without a formal published theory - it was informally understood by those who were on the mailing lists.<p>And I agree, RPC isn't wrong, the point is that it is fundamentally flawed approach if your goal is interoperability at a global scale.   If you want client A to talk to server B, have at it, just don't call it REST or assume you'll get the desirable properties.  Many so-called REST APIs aren't globally interoperable due to this conceptual baggage, but some are better than others.<p>As for the emotional appeal, my point is... these debates have been discussed ad nauseam for nearly 15 years, with many cases involving personal sacrifice (justified or not).   Debating on the merits is fine, but having ot go back to first principles every 5 years for a new generation means we are just spinning our wheels.   That's why there often is appeal to history or authority.   i.e. \"Read the mailing lists, they're archived\", etc.   That's not a great situation, I admit.
