The root cause of SOPA is a culture of piracy and a lack of participation by leaders in technology to develop better enforcement regulations.<p>Laws like SOPA are going to continue to be proposed until a better solution to copyright protection is enacted.  If we leave those proposals to be constructed by media companies who don't care as much about the integrity of the internet as they do about their bottom line, you'll just keep getting new laws that overreach and threaten our freedoms.  The fact that we're facing SOPA is bad, but it's the direct result of too many people pretending that copyright protection isn't an important issue that deserves better solutions, both by arguing against the rights of creators, and failing to proactively help create a better system of enforcement.<p>If you really want to do something powerful to stop SOPA-like legislation in its various forms, your essay should also aim to remind people that we're facing this legislation because people engage in piracy, and that we need leaders in the tech community to be more proactive about improving the DMCA if they want to have a voice in what shape copyright protection takes.  It might seem like SOPA is \"the problem\" but it's really one party's proposed solution to a very real issue.  An argument for why SOPA is bad without proposals about how to meet the needs of the party for whom SOPA is a solution only sends those people back to their misguided drawing board.<p>I respect the stand you've taken against SOPA.

Often small companies pop up who use this method until they're big enough to be noticed, and then they go back and negotiate retro-active deals.  This creates an unfair advantage for them over companies who choose to operate completely within the law.  These companies' only responsibility is to take the material down when they get caught, with no steeper penalty for repeat offenses or for building a business around this turnaround time.  Grooveshark is an example of an American company that falls into this category.<p>If you could see the number of takedown requests and repeat violations companies receive (I propose they be issued and resolved through a centralized database), it would be clear which companies exist almost exclusively to provide access to copyrighted material, or who do not place high enough priority on preventing copyright infringement.  I believe they need to be held accountable without placing the burden of pursuing civil penalties on the backs of individual or small company rights holders for whom a lawsuit is not equitable.  There should be severe penalties for companies whose infractions far outweigh the legitimate value they provide.  Those penalties should not require a class action lawsuit or the war chest of some large company.<p>Then there are companies who are just outright havens for illegal material, whether hosting it themselves or making user-shared content easy to find and access.  Most of these companies are offshore, or they are only providing links and information without providing the content itself, both of which makes it hard to pursue civil penalty.  I think there should be a clearly defined and transparent method for measuring the degree to which sites provide little value beyond access to illegal material, and those sites should be held accountable.  There has to be actionable recourse and, unfortunately, you can only pursue civil penalties from companies who are domestic (or in a participating country) or who actually profit from their actions.  In the case of sites who are not domestic or who do not generate meaningful financial gain for their illegal behavior, your only real option is to shut them down in one way or another.  If the criteria for a site being eligible for this type of action is clear, and the infraction history is transparent, I have a hard time justifying not taking action against them.  That being said, I do understand that we live in a world where rules are abused and I don't understand everything I need to about how such rules would be enforced.  But I don't think the the fact that it's difficult and not foolproof are good enough reasons not to pursue a better system.<p>The DMCA has put the burden of policing copyright on the shoulders of rights holders and that's fine, but penalizing companies who commit massive infringement should not be the job of a bunch of small artists and independent companies.  Then there are companies for whom the option of legal recourse is not an option, and those people should be handled in the strictest way possible without putting too much power in the hands of arbitrary organizations.", "link": "item?id=3390041", "user": "earbitscom"}, {"comment": "People have different ideas about what is necessary.

Cutting the potential upside of the big hits does disproportionate damage to the overall industry's expected returns. I know you were specifically discussing books where initial production costs are low (in comparison to marketing), but consider what happens to film and television.<p>As you say, under a new regime without copyright as-is, new people may come in to fill the void.

Generally, things produced by individuals with relatively little \"refinement\" (sound, graphics, costumes, marketing, etc.) seem like good candidates for business model innovation. On the other hand, the pilot episode of \"Lost\" cost millions of dollars just in production (i.e. before they even had any idea if it would be popular and got a marketing budget).
