<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thanks pg.<p>My intent was not to bash Jobs, quite the opposite as I called him "one of the best CEOs ever to live" in the conclusion.<p>My goal is to reflect on what skills are really important in an early startup. The Apple II wasn't a success because of Jobs's leadership or because of his design focus like with the iPhone. Founders don't think about Markkula's role in getting the Apple II mainstream. Furthermore, Jobs had to fail over and over, wasting millions of dollars, before he tamed his bad habits and realized what would work. Then again, I only know what I'm talking about from reading Isaacson's biography and doing my own research.

I do not almost nothing about those early years, but I get the impression that what made the Apple ][ a success is that it got accepted as a office machine.

There is, as I said before, a large random multiplier in the success of any company. So in practice the deal is not that you're 30 times as productive and get paid 30 times as much. It is that you're 30 times as productive, and get paid between zero and a thousand times as much.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The frequentist way you're doing probability in that comment is not valid since the success or failure of one particular startup is not a repeatable experiment. The only valid interpretations are (1) the frequentist probability across a group of startups and (2) the degree of belief, or bayesian probability of a single startup's success. In this framework it is entirely reasonable to assign a 10% probability of success to one particular startup. I agree that if you knew beforehand that you're in the small group of people whose success rate exceeds your standard for reliability, then for that person a startup would be a reliable way to get rich.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I would have to agree. For all the belly-aching about Wall Street in NYC's tech community, you're guaranteed a significant income for a number of years.<p>For this equality to hold:<p><pre><code>    E(Wall Street hacker's earnings) == E(startup founder's earnings) </code></pre>
you need an extremely high payoff, since<p><pre><code>    E(startup founder's earnings) == P(startup success) * payoff of startup.
</code></pre>
and we know the probability of success at a startup is low.<p>Everyone on HN needs to be honest with themselves: this kind of high payoff <i>almost never happens</i>, in aggregate. And I haven't even included a risk premium, which would make the required payoff higher!<p>If wealth capture is a main concern, you're better off building a nest egg at a hedge fund or large corporation for 10 years. If you want to start a startup, do it for the culture and technological freedom. From a statistical view, however, a startup is not the optimal way to become rich.<p>EDIT: mynegation reminded me of risk-adjusted returns.

So there's a variety of ways to get rich and we want to know which one is easier: work for someone else vs start your own company. My point is that 99.9% of the world population work for someone else while only a really small percentage started a company. And only a really small percentage of the world population is rich. Even if only of 1% of the rich people started their own company, there's still truth to what the article said. So, I was saying it's a fact that your chances to get rich are much higher having your own company than working for someone else.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"though I'd want to see some data there -- there's was a recent study showing that for poor children attending preschool was a very good predictor of life success; this would seem to argue counter to your assertion"<p>In terms of data, here is the graph showing how SES effects achievement for school kids:<p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1655696/SES_and_school.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1655696/SES_and_school.jpg</a><p>It's a little difficult to read, but basically what you can see is that poor kids and rich kids learn roughly the same amount in school. The reason there is such a big gap is because A) there is a large gap that already exists when they get to Kindergarten and B) while rich kids are learn over the summer and get smarter, the poor kids are actually forgetting what they've learned the previous year.<p>If you want to learn about why there is already a 2 year gap before the kids get to kindergarten, you should read the book Meaningful Differences In The Everyday Experience of Young American Children.<p>The finding about within school differences vs. between school differences comes from the Coleman report, which is one of the largest social surveys ever conducted, and still one of the most important to date. I also have a blog post here explaining a bit about why within school differences are important:<p><a href="http://alexkrupp.typepad.com/sensemaking/2009/02/the-most-important-graph-in-education.html" rel="nofollow">http://alexkrupp.typepad.com/sensemaking/2009/02/the-most-im...</a><p>If I remember correctly efficacy of preschool is mixed, and it depends a lot on the type of preschool. However, even the best preschools can never be as effective as good parenting at imparting language schools, for reasons that the Meaningful Difference book explains.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You're right about good parenting being a bad term. However, it is the qualities (value neutral) of the parenting that determines outcome rather than the richness of the environment. To quote Paul Tough, who gives a good summary of the research:<p>"The disadvantages that poverty imposes on children aren't primarily about material goods. True, every poor child would benefit from having more books in his home and more nutritious food to eat (and money certainly makes it easier to carry out a program of concerted cultivation). But the real advantages that middle-class children gain come from more elusive processes: the language that their parents use, the attitudes toward life that they convey. However you measure child-rearing, middle-class parents tend to do it differently than poor parents; and the path they follow in turn tends to give their children an array of advantages. As Lareau points out, kids from poor families might be nicer, they might be happier, they might be more polite; but in countless ways, the manner in which they are raised puts them at a disadvantage in the measures that count in contemporary American society."</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3209409 href="vote?for=3209409&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%6f%37%46%39%42%74%6f%6a%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3209409></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=anamax">anamax</a> 87 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3209409">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"How can we measure the 'soul' of a lesson, and what happens when a lesson lacks 'soul'?"<p>A good proxy would be just looking at whether something was made by an artist, or a committee. E.g. Feynman's lectures were those of an artist, whereas most textbooks are created by a committee. (And then they get someone with a PhD to add their name as the author after the fact.) It's clear to me that Kahn's lessons are more in the style of the typical textbook, rather than in the style of someone like Feynman. You can't measure it, that's the point. If you could measure it then that's the first sign that something is wrong.<p>"But I guess since they are the highest castes, they are the ones who's mysticism we should adopt."<p>I'm not advocating the hindu model per se, only using them as an example of a society where schooling is framed in terms of a larger model... In their case one that includes work, marriage, wisdom seeking, preparation for death, etc. It's not clear to me that this is the right approach for western society, but I do think it's worth looking at for inspiration.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3209017 href="vote?for=3209017&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%6f%37%46%39%42%74%6f%6a%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3209017></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=yummyfajitas">yummyfajitas</a> 87 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3209017">link</a></span></div><br>

For more than twenty years now, all public schools anywhere in the state offer open enrollment to all students anywhere in the state, up to the limits of the capacity of each school district to receive students.<p><a href="http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/Academic_Excellence/School_Choice/Public_School_Choice/Open_Enrollment/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/Academic_Excellence/School_...</a><p>So if students don't like what is on offer in their local school district, they can shop around, and take their state funding with them, by trying out another school district's offerings of courses and teachers (and classmates). More students enrolled means more state funding, so school districts make efforts to provide attractive programs that will bring students across district lines. This competition among school districts has promoted innovation in programs and resulted in a fair amount of interchange among students who live in different neighborhoods. School districts compete with one another by offeringprograms for fine-arts-inclined students, or students who desire language immersion programs (Spanish immersion and Chinese immersion programs are both hot programs in Minnesota), and students with many other characteristics. Some school districts gain almost half of their enrollment from open enrollment, and correspondingly some of the historically worst school districts in Minnesota have lost large percentages of enrollment to families crossing district boundaries to look for better schools. (Minnesota also has a huge number of charter schools, which is a distinct form of competition for publicly subsidized students, but they cannot offer some of the programs that public school districts can.) This competition keeps all districts accountable for providing a good learning environment, and helps change the psychology of teachers and principals dealing with families from one of treating learners as a burden to one of treating learners as an opportunity to be grateful for.<p>Any other state in the United States could do the same, and a few already have.<p><a href="http://educateiowa.gov/index.php?option=com_content&#38;task=view&#38;id=649&#38;Itemid=636" rel="nofollow">http://educateiowa.gov/index.php?option=com_content&#38;task...</a><p><a href="http://www.ecs.org/html/offsite.asp?document=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eecs%2Eorg%2FOpenEnrollmentDatabase" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecs.org/html/offsite.asp?document=http%3A%2F%2Fww...</a><p><i>abolishing private schools</i><p>Abolishing private schools is a distinctly bad idea (as shown by the example of the Netherlands, where multiple kinds of schools receive public funding on a per-capita basis) and anyway is unconstitutional in the United States.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Education isn't a race. If rich children perform better that  doesn't worsen the plight of poor children. Rather, a better educated populace increases the wealth of society enabling us to spend more on programs for the poor.<p>Furthermore, the game may be rigged against poor students, but it isn't rigged by the rich. It's rigged by the teachers unions. Some schools that serve poor children have the highest per-student budgets in the nation (see: DC). But they still perform abysmally. Rich parents have the free time to browbeat administrators of low-performing schools until things change. Poor parents are too busy trying to make ends meet. Their children are stuck with whatever the bureaucracy gives them.<p>This is why school choice programs have displayed promising performance in many low-income areas. They allow students to escape quagmires of union-driven mediocrity. It's interesting that you would want to get rid of the best chance for poor children to get a good education! The DC opportunity scholarship fund increased high school graduation rates by 20% by sending poor kids to private schools. That's a big deal - having a high school diploma substantially increases lifetime earnings.<p>True to form, the unions killed the DC Opportunity Scholarship fund after only a few years of operation. It's hard to make change for the benefit of the poor! But fortunately, the house Republicans brought the program back with their electoral sweep in 2010, so we will get to continue to monitor its results.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3209015 href="vote?for=3209015&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%6f%37%46%39%42%74%6f%6a%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3209015></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=barrkel">barrkel</a> 87 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3209015">link</a></span></div><br>

The general public doesn't get the same kind of place at the table, by far. But politicians are not embarrassed by that. They call special access for special interest groups "taking care to consider the point of view of stakeholders," and don't think about policy in terms of what's right in the abstract, but rather in terms of what's expedient for staying out of political trouble. A quiet majority of inadequately educated Americans struggling to find time for political participation while making ends meet has less voice in the process than a vocal minority of wealthy people whining about "class warfare," and also less voice than a minority of people employed by publicly funded schools who are not held accountable for results.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3208676 href="vote?for=3208676&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%6f%37%46%39%42%74%6f%6a%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3208676></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=klbarry">klbarry</a> 88 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3208676">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"I am very interested in seeing data against the KIPP model - what sources would you recommend?"<p>There's very little data, which is the main problem. In terms of books about KIPP, the one I've read is Whatever It Takes, which is about Geoffrey Canada, who founded the Harlem Children's Zone. I'm not sure if this school is technically affiliated with KIPP proper, but it used the KIPP model.<p>It's very difficult to explain the problems with KIPP. Basically you need to take a really good look at how the kids are actually spending their days, and then compare it with what we know about child development, educational research, best practices in various fields, research data on student achievement, etc. I don't think there is any way to understand it without having a solid background in education theory, education research, cognitive development, psychology, early childhood education, history, and even things like organization behavior and management theory, etc. The problem of what makes a good school and a good classroom is insanely complicated, which is why we've been using basically the same model since WWI.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3208969 href="vote?for=3208969&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%6f%37%46%39%42%74%6f%6a%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3208969></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=yummyfajitas">yummyfajitas</a> 87 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3208969">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This is a tough thing for founders.  I was in this situation earlier this year after I won a ticket to Google I/O.  One of the events was a Google Ventures mixer, which turned out to be a "speed-dating" event.  I was excited to meet Joe Kraus, who gave my favorite Startup School speech ever, but what to do in this format?  Launch into a cooked-up pitch?  But I wanted to talk to Joe, not use him for target practice based on his job.  But wasn't that kind of what I was expected to do?  Still, what a borderline-presumptuous missionary tack to take with someone I respect.  But wouldn't I get over that knowing teammates were counting on me to get us funding any way we could?<p>At last, I decided to skip the pitch, chatted very pleasantly with Joe, got some great advice and his card.  In retrospect, that was really about as much as I should expect in a five-minute sit-down.  He seems twice as much of a great guy as I thought he was.  The pitch can wait until the next time we cross paths or it's been a lot better tested.  But I better recognize now how awkward these situations can get.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3205239 href="vote?for=3205239&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%6f%37%46%39%42%74%6f%6a%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3205239></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 88 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3205239">link</a></span></div><br>

That's when you can say your few words about what you do and what you are working on.  If the other person is interested they might ask a question.  You say something like:<p>"I'm a app/web developer who just finished contracting at the fastest growing company in the world making apps for fortune 100s and am now working on a start up doing Travel Guide-Apps."<p>Their eyes may glaze over half way through your "I'm a web developer..." at which point you notice this and drop it, ask them what they do, or ask them some other question.<p>Anyway, I guess that is basic 101 conversation techniques.<p>A fun game I used to play with friends in bars/clubs was introducing someone else.  My friend would pretend to be a french student new to the city and I was introducing them around.

Don't brag about how awesome you are and don't get into details about who you work for or how awesome they are.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thanks for the comment, Paul. Blog posts are funny, b/c you have to boil down a bunch of complex ideas into something people can grok while skimming. I actually don't like the word "pitch" or think of myself as someone who really pitches things very well at all. But it does describe sharing your ideas with other people, capturing it in a single word. A more accurate description would be "sharing your vision" or something similar.<p>If there's one thing I've learned over the years (whether meeting new startup people or trying to get a date) it's been the "don't be a douchebag" rule. Treat people like people. The best "pitch" is actually not a pitch. It's authentic, where you're talking to someone who you <i>honestly</i> believe will be interested in what you're doing, and you're sharing something you're sincerely excited about.<p>The last person you want to be is one of the "Jersey shore meatheads" trying to dry hump some poor woman out on the dance floor (to harken back to my earlier analogy). :)</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3204286 href="vote?for=3204286&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%6f%37%46%39%42%74%6f%6a%4a"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3204286></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dpapathanasiou">dpapathanasiou</a> 88 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3204286">link</a></span></div><br>
