<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>So there is some discussion in the other thread, but I'll add my own. You ask that philosophy be useful. Here then, is a useful question:<p>Suppose that my mother has Alzheimer's disease, and that I find the prospect of caring for her inconvenient, undesirable, and/or expensive. Do I have a responsibility to care for her anyway?<p>It is "useful" because it could potentially describe a real-life situation in which one might have to make a decision. Analyzing this quickly leads one to a general discussion of ethics.<p>As you point out, definitions are imprecise. What does it mean to say I have a "responsibility", or that I "ought" to do something? Logic and observation can get one to "If I do nothing, then my mother will suffer and/or die", but this is not the heart of the matter.<p>I think there is no hope of a "solution", in the same way, say, that Fermat's Last Theorem was proved. But does that mean that studying ethics, and what the usual lineup of dead white males had to say about it, isn't worthwhile?</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3011825 href="vote?for=3011825&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%43%30%4b%62%35%72%46%34%6e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3011825></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 137 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3011825">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Paul, I don't think my grandmother could give me a very good justification for why she eats meat. I, however, armed with Singer's arguments from <i>Animal Liberation</i> could show that eating meat needs to be justified and that I can't justify it. Same goes for whether profiting from closed source software is ethical. Same goes for whether homosexuality is evil. These are all cases in which it would be possible to show, systematically, how one's views are contradictory, or really empirical questions.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Funny, then, that I, armed with the same arguments, just had a delicious steak for dinner. I imagine many a philosopher has considered Singer's arguments and had a delicious steak nonetheless; mathematicians and scientists don't have this problem.<p>The problem with ethics is that you can't show systematically that meat, closed source software, homosexuality, infanticide, government, self-defense, or torture are justified or unjustified. You have to have some type of basis for logic, and even if you come up with some sort of foundational principle, there's nothing special about foundational principles that makes one any more or less likely to reject them than the conclusions you reach from them. The history of ethics is a history of people working out logically consistent ethical systems only to discover that they justified things like kidnapping strangers and killing them for their organs, and based on the "moral intuition" that it's wrong to kidnap strangers and kill them for their organs, the logically consistent ethical system was amended. The history of philosophy is filled with this kind of thing, but let's think about what we're doing here! What do we need ethics for if all we're going to do is change them when they end up having unintuitive results?</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3013163 href="vote?for=3013163&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%43%30%4b%62%35%72%46%34%6e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3013163></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=impendia">impendia</a> 137 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3013163">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Look at your assumptions: That suffering is a good measurement to use to draw the line, that large animal suffering is the place to argue about it, and that large animals yes/no is the granularity to use, and repeatedly coming back to whether I can demonstrate that plants feel suffering, despite my claimed disinterest in that point.<p>All of the above are arguable - why not argue that humans and cattle are inedible, but question where the line between insects and small mammal suffering is? Why not question whether stupid non-suffering cows are OK to kill? Or whether non-suffering humans are OK to kill and eat?<p>Even if you continue with your line, there are other ways you could argue it - if suffering is bad, then that doesn't mean eating animals is bad, you could tranquillise before killing and it would be OK. Or if you want to minimise suffering then wild animals aren't OK, and all animals should have a human managed lifespan from sedated birth to anaesthetised death followed by being eaten, and not-eating-animals but leaving them to die "naturally" is worse.<p>And there's room to step back and say suffering is a behaviour and thought pattern that's only of interest to the creature connected to that nervous system - otherwise of no interest, so why go for 'minimise suffering' at all? You could argue about methane emissions or water/other resource use, for why it's unethical to prioritise farming animals for food, or you could look at it as a social signalling - wanting to signal that we understand suffering and choose to avoid it or as a personal suffering (guilt) reduction aside from the animal suffering, or you could believe in a deity which punishes you after death for animal suffering you caused.<p>But however you look at it, you come back to: humans have to eat, so plants or animals have to be ethically OK to eat, and we don't want hurt selves or relatives and friends, so cannibalism can't be OK, but within that, whether extending compassion to animals is "right" or not, it's not objective - refusing to eat farm animals because the calculation on their methane emissions leading to global warming effects and future human suffering would be, but where the ethical line in farming living creatures for food is, is not. It's just arguable back and forth.<p><i>I eagerly await your finding that vegetables feel pain.</i><p>Even if they don't feel pain, they have a natural life, lifespan, life processes and reproduction which eating them stops.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>In regards to philosophy having a 'use':<p>I think philosophy should have a function/use. But does it? I think its functional importance is in asking questions in such a way they can be answered by experiment.<p>So in the philosophy of mind, the functional role of philosophy is to refine concepts so there is a conceptual difference that makes a difference in experiment.<p>The problem is, there is no way to tell if you are doing useful philosophy if we define its function as creating the conditions for experiment to take over. We can only tell if philosophy is useful in retrospect, by the impact a work has. Philosophy is not like science, where we know we are 'doing science' by performing experiments. But it also is like science, in that we judge it's use retrospectively.<p>A good example of philosophy being useful is the case of Bertrand Russell's work on 'Russell's Paradox'. Russell's work in the Principia Mathematica was partially about formulating definitions that would free us of this paradox.<p>PG says <i>"Outside of math there's a limit to how far you can push words; in fact, it would not be a bad definition of math to call it the study of terms that have precise meanings."</i><p>Surely there is use in forming these precise meanings in the first place. Some (not all) of that work is philosophy.<p>Russell's work was outside of math, or at a minimum it was 'Meta-math'. Russell was attempting to crystallize new logical definitions that could form precise definitions, and hence become mathematics. He was trying to create mathematics from philosophy.<p>Did it work? No. The Principia Mathematica was a failure. But the way it failed, it failed as a piece of mathematics, at the hands of Kurt Godel. Here is a case of philosophy becoming mathematics. In short, Godel's work leads to the work of Church and Turing, which leads to the computer.<p>So we can at least point to the concrete usefulness of some philosophy, retrospectively. This work was useful, even if its only effect was to shift around the conceptual landscape so non-philosophers could do 'serious work'.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3011914 href="vote?for=3011914&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%43%30%4b%62%35%72%46%34%6e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3011914></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=impendia">impendia</a> 137 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3011914">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#5a5a5a>PakG1, you have a good point.  Accusing someone of "selectively ignoring" evidence is suggesting the person is not seeking truth at all.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Forking the conversation, but going out of your way to make yourself agreeable is not efficient conversation.  Now, the workplace and an Internet forum may differ in terms of environment, but if I applied "going out of my way to be civil" to the workplace, it would make for a lot of inefficient conversation and meetings.  Being direct is much more preferable in the workplace, and as long as you leave out insults and profanity, it can be quite civil.  That is what I'd expect in everyday life as well.  My standards of comparing the workplace and other environments may not be shared.<p>Perhaps you would prefer people use more phrases like "I think", "I feel like", or pose sentences as questions.  I suppose that works well enough for me without destroying conversation efficiency too much.<p>The word "accusation" has a broad spectrum of emotion, but perhaps a very narrow emotive connotation when heard by the accused.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3012258 href="vote?for=3012258&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%43%30%4b%62%35%72%46%34%6e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3012258></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=onan_barbarian">onan_barbarian</a> 137 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3012258">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It is a bit sad to avoid the discussion with pg below (maybe it is in preparation?)<p>For me there is one (very excusable) "blind" point in pg's position, it's Eastern classic philosophy (hear Confucianism and a bit of Taoism). For some, it will not even be considered philosophy, because it do not ask questions about questions. It is closer to politics, because it tries to answer the one important question (in Eastern eyes), how to have human beings living together without too much blood. Answers are complex, and rely on ethics, self-cultivation, etc. Studying these Classics is not just for statisfying one's curiosity about past things, it will help understand the world, and what to be in the world, all of that without any "magic trick" (hear God, promise of the paradise).<p>I don't think the ommissions you are talking about are on these lines, so it would be nice to see where these ommission make pg's essay unfair.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3012091 href="vote?for=3012091&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%43%30%4b%62%35%72%46%34%6e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3012091></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=YuriNiyazov">YuriNiyazov</a> 137 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3012091">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Very interesting article; although here's what I think gets missed when folks teach and talk about Philosophy since Russell: anything that smells even vaguely religious just doesn't count -- don't read it -- too spooky, too irrational.  The only reason Greeks get away with it is, I think, because nobody takes the Greek gods seriously anymore (or at least no one is worried about too many people doing so, and causing trouble in the name of Zeus!)<p>So no King Solomon, no Vedas and probably no Confucius either, as secular as he tended to be.<p>You mentioned at the end of the article that"...philosophy was hopelessly intermingled with religion. It didn't shake itself free till a couple hundred years ago..."  I'd have to counter that philosophy without religion is generally new, hollow and unworthy of much study -- which in some ways I think is your point.<p>I'm genuinely curious: Why (or if) you think that this decoupling is a good thing?  So few other disciplines (only  Religious Studies, and perhaps The Arts) ever touch upon the idea of spirit at all -- which I think is at the core of Philosophy -- the nexus of Sapience and Sentience.  If one is not a fan of religion on principle (its over-adherence to both dogma, and dominance are two criticisms that I have), then certainly this is a <i>strength</i> of Philosophy -- the decoupling of religion from matters of the spirit/soul.  Spinoza's The Ethics; and Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil are two interesting books for students of Philosophy to consider.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3007096 href="vote?for=3007096&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%43%30%4b%62%35%72%46%34%6e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3007096></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 139 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3007096">link</a> | <a href="item?id=3007000">parent</a> | on: <a href="item?id=3006785">The Patent Pledge</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Agreed. The guy may be a crook, but something about that piece doesn't sit well.<p>For instance, why are all these private law firms spending all this time and money chasing this guy around? Certainly not out of some kind of goodwill on their part. Do they get a cut of what's collected? Are they being paid by somebody? I don't ask because I want to impeach their motives -- it's just a critical part of any story. Any "chase" story has a chaser and a person chased. We're missing key details.<p>I would also want to hear from the guy in question. What's his side of the story? Even horrible wartime criminals end up on CNN telling us all their side of the story, but this guy gets nothing.<p>Plus, it's obvious that as a reader I am supposed to have a reaction. Something like "That cheap bastard! I hope they jack the jail up and put him underneath" or some such. Maybe it was just me, but I felt the author trying to push my buttons along those lines. I find being manipulated like that uncomfortable.<p>Not a quality article in my book. But heck, that's not saying the guy didn't do something wrong.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; I think humans may have a genetic predisposition to equality. What made me realize this was going to Africa and seeing lots of animals in the wild. All or nearly all the big mammals lived in groups and cooperated to survive. It was clear that our ancestors would in their day have been one of these groups, also cooperating to survive (as hunter-gatherers still do in a few places), and that their cooperative inclinations were probably genetically preprogrammed.<p>I'm not sure living in groups and cooperating implies a genetic predisposition to equality. Even though a group might have, say, twenty to fifty members, some members tend to rule and others tend to hang on the outskirts. I'd pick Venkat Rao's division into Sociopaths, Clueless, and Losers (<a href="http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-or-the-office-according-to-the-office" rel="nofollow">http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/10/07/the-gervais-principle-o...</a>) as the best way to divide up types of people in such a group. He writes about their role in businesses, but it's the same in a small societal group. The Sociopaths are the jocks who absolutely must have the power, eat the most food, and have the most offspring. The Losers are the ones who live at the edge of the group, eat the least food, and be eaten first by predators. The Clueless are the majority who follow the Sociopaths' rules and rise slowly through the group hierarchy to their natural level of competence.<p>Perhaps society is best modeled as a cell, where the Sociopaths are the nucleus and the Losers are the membrane. It does seem to be a male-oriented model, where females act more like glue, facilitating relationships. The male Sociopaths would have two or more females each, eat the food, feed the women, and produce the most offspring. The male Clueless would only have one female and follow whatever other rules the Sociopaths impose, and get food based on their rank in society. Perhaps the females overall are most similar to male Clueless in this model.<p>The male Losers would be the first to miss out on the food, not get any girls, and die young, being the first to be sacrificed to predators. And maybe there's the reason why Sociopaths naturally shun any interaction with Losers, going through the Clueless intermediaries, as in "the jocks hate the nerds". When there's any threat to their survival or status, the Sociopaths in the nucleus can't afford to have any emotional attachment to the Losers in the outer membrane. They need to be able to sacrifice Losers without hesitating if that's required for their own survival.<p>I guess I'm saying not only are mammals built out of biological cells internally, but also make up societal cells externally. When there's plenty of food and the group grows too big, the Sociopaths start electioneering among the Clueless for loyalty. The group will eventually split in half, just like cells do, some Sociopaths taking some of the Clueless with them and the others taking the other Clueless. When there's just enough food for the Sociopaths to multiply but not enough Clueless for a successful cell split, the Sociopaths will turn on one another, a coup takes place, and the losing Sociopaths killed or thrown outside the membrane.<p>This model describes how a genetic predisposition to inequality and hierarchy can also explain group living and apparent cooperation.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2983959 href="vote?for=2983959&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%43%30%4b%62%35%72%46%34%6e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2983959></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=lwhi">lwhi</a> 145 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2983959">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; I mean this inclination doesn't imply anything about what economic policy should be<p>Isn't it disingenuous to infer that this inclination should not imply anything about economic policy? I would arrive at the opposite conclusion. Economics are sentiment driven by a huge factor. Robert Shiller's work in behavioral economics and his book Irrational exuberance has established and popularized this idea. Krugman's discussion of the unsuitability of BitCoin as a currency rests largely on the peculiar nature of human sentiment and behavior. Large income gaps are perceived by most people as unfair irrespective of the contributions by the wealthy. No one thinks that Bill Gates/ Edison made a greater contribution to social progress than Einstein/Gandhi. I don't think the association of the net worth of an individual to the contribution that they have made to society is very strong. Economies rewards people largely on the basis of demand/supply with I believe is a weak proxy for social contributions.<p>Perhaps you want to draw an analogy to say gay marriage where the popular vote might end up denying gay rights, but I don't think a similar argument holds in the case of wealth distribution.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2982918 href="vote?for=2982918&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%43%30%4b%62%35%72%46%34%6e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2982918></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sokoloff">sokoloff</a> 145 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2982918">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The physics community was already converging on the special theory of relativity when Einstein published it. All the signs were there --and had been for quite a while--, but someone needed to add 1 + 1 together and accept the implications.

This is an urban legend. There were dozens of people that immediately understood it and hundreds that understood it after some additional explanation. That doesn't mean they accepted it in the absence of experimental confirmation.<p>However, the General theory was a far greater achievement than the Special theory, because the idea of mass influencing the geometry of space-time was far less obvious and it may have been a decade before anyone else would have investigated that possibility. Nevertheless: someone else would have come up with it. Einstein was no greater than any of the other great physicists of the time, who each had brilliant idea.

However outside of Hilbert and Einstein no one was looking at Reimannian Geometry for answers.<p>&#62; The physics community was already converging on the special theory of relativity<p>They had the Lorentz equations for decades but were not getting anywhere close to the final result apart from Poincare. And even Poincare inspite of getting almost all equations lined up, seemed to miss the fact that there is no absolute time and that time is only partially and not totally ordered. Einstein hit the nail on the head inspite of the fact that Lorentz/Poincare had been working on the problem for possibly decades. It still seems likely that Poincare could have arrived at the result.<p>This is the reason I cited GR. As far as I know, no one apart from Einstein/Hilbert seemed to ave been working on it.<p>In hindsight special relativity was "obvious", but Maxwell's equations had been around for decades and the Lorentz transforms emerged in 1887 and yet no one was able to make the mental leap required to re-interpret the nature of Time. SR could have ended up taking decades more to sort out. Einstein hit the ball out of the park in his 20s when the scientists working on the problem had spent decades on it. And GR could have only followed after SR.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2983243 href="vote?for=2983243&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%43%30%4b%62%35%72%46%34%6e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2983243></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=william42">william42</a> 145 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2983243">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>That's difficult to compare. For my own life, the PC and then internet were a lot more disruptive than anything directly related to relativity theory, although there may be indirect connections that I don't understand.<p>And it's very much a matter of timing. If IBM had been able to delay the broad commercial success of PCs by 15 years, which is not inconceivable, it would have been too late for me to choose a career in this field.<p>I think the great commercializers like Bill Gates or Edison have made tremendous contributions to society. You need business model disruption in order to make new technologies broadly accessible.<p>However, I do understand what you're saying.

His products were rarely acceptable alternatives if evaluated on their own merits and sold largely because of strong-arm deals with the OEMs.<p>While I have cited Bill Gates as a weaker contributor than Einstein/Gandhi, I think you are being far too critical here and missing a few key things. The fundamental insight that Bill Gates had was that software is king and the hardware is the add on. Even Steve Jobs credited Bill for the insight at D5. All other competing OSes at the time were a hardware and software bundle. Bill realized that what was of essence was the software and the hardware wasn't as important. He licensed the software and commoditized the hardware industry into a fierce race to the bottom that saw PC prices dropping every month. If Apple/Amiga had won that round we would be spending a couple of grand on a PC even to this day and poorer economies wouldn't have been able to afford computers as freely as they do now.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=320></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2983571 href="vote?for=2983571&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%43%30%4b%62%35%72%46%34%6e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2983571></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=prodigal_erik">prodigal_erik</a> 145 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2983571">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There were quite a few pure-software platforms that never got off the ground because OEMs didn't dare even offer them as options for fear of angering Microsoft. Unless you were savvy enough to build your own machine from parts, they made it as hard as they possibly could to <i>avoid</i> paying for a copy of DOS and later Windows whether or not you would have preferred to run something else. Most famously, Be got a $23M settlement over this, yet never managed to get fair access to the marketplace so they could compete on commodity hardware.

The boom was happening before MS and the PC, and before Apple too.<p>Just as an example, it'd be as reasonable to credit RMS for the hardware commoditization as Gates. Stallman was largely personally responsible for reinventing proprietary lisp-machine functionality.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I don't know if people are opposed to mere inequality. Some people may not like when they have average income while some people are "filthy rich", and on that point I will agree that their resentment towards the rich is not justified much.<p>However, there's another aspect of inequality: when a significantly large number of people are living in poverty, while others are "filthy rich". In this context, the issue is real and important, and people are right in being concerned about it.<p>Even though the word inequality means merely "not equal" and could very well refer to the fact that some people are rich while some other aren't, I think that what most people really mean by "inequality" is the second case: where some people are extremely poor while some others are extremely rich.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2983929 href="vote?for=2983929&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%43%30%4b%62%35%72%46%34%6e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2983929></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=egiva">egiva</a> 145 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2983929">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thanks for this comment. Humans certainly are predisposed to equality, but it might better be termed as "reciprocity".<p>You may have read a very famous book by Jared Diamond called "Guns, Germs and Steel" which won the '98 Pulitzer in nonfiction. A lot of these conversations about wealth and equality (and why they are not equal among different sets of society, or among countries) are addressed in the book. This is definitely a life-changing read worth looking into.<p>Because you might be really (really) busy, I also recommend a short article that sumarizes a lot of the themes in an interesting way: <a href="http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/SocJusticeRes.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.umass.edu/preferen/gintis/SocJusticeRes.pdf</a>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There are examples of this sort of cooperation to survive in primitive human societies. Inuit Eskimos will share their game with the whole village.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think this predisposition may be not for equality but for cooperation. We have empathy, we have child care hard-wired and we have some sort of protection against cheaters, to benefit the whole community. (it is not a cultural invention, it is, like you've said, genetic predisposition).<p>Equality/inequality is, I think, a cultural factor. Culture is also subject to some sort of evolution process, which means that some inventions got lost, but some remain and evolve. So, more equal society is indeed more stable and healthy. You might not see so intense struggling or competition which means less innovation and so-called progress, but innovations or progress aren't among ultimate goals of the process of human evolution.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2982562 href="vote?for=2982562&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%43%30%4b%62%35%72%46%34%6e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2982562></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jseliger">jseliger</a> 146 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2982562">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Here's a request that's unlikely to be fulfilled but one I'll make anyway: assemble an essay collection aimed at high school / college students. In my ideal world, it would contain in about this order:<p>1) What You'll Wish You'd Known<p>2) What You Can't Say<p>3) Disconnecting Distraction<p>4) The Age of the Essay<p>5) Why Nerds are Unpopular<p>6) Writing, Briefly<p>7) Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas<p>8) Good and Bad Procrastination<p>9) How to Do What You Love<p>10) See Randomness<p>11) The Power of the Marginal<p>12) How Art Can Be Good<p>13) Taste for Makers<p>14) Two Kinds of Judgement<p>15) Stuff<p>There's obviously some overlap with this list and <i>Hackers &#38; Painters</i>. But I think this grouping would be much more useful for the general population; most freshmen aren't as keen on programming language discussions.<p>I often use the first three essays listed above in the freshman comp classes I teach, and they often yield interesting reactions from students. Sometimes we venture into "The Age of the Essay" and "Stuff." Students who are especially interested in why high school is structured the way it is often get pointers to "Why Nerds Are Unpopular."<p>If you know anyone at O'Reilly, you can tell them they'd get about 50 copies a semester ordered. That's probably pretty small time, but I suppose something is better than nothing.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2982738 href="vote?for=2982738&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%43%30%4b%62%35%72%46%34%6e"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2982738></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 146 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2982738">link</a></span></div><br>
