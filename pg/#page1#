big successes like Dropbox and Airbnb than from HR acquisitions that
they'd be acting counter to their own interest to focus their attention
on the latter.  Far from making out in HR acquisitions, early stage
investors generally get screwed in them.  We often make zero from an HR
acquisition, between liquidation preferences belonging to later stage investors and the fact that much of the supposed acquisition price is          
set aside as incentives for the founders to stay with the acquirer.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3548359&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3548381 href="vote?for=3548381&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3548381></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=lallysingh">lallysingh</a> 4 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3548381">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The expected value of turning down the current offer is almost always positive.  It's very rare for founders to reject an acquisition offer and then later wish they'd taken it.<p>The difference between founders and investors is that founders care about more than just expected value.  A founder with no assets other than his stock in the company will often prefer to sell now and lock in the current price rather than keep rolling the dice.  So to the extent there is a difference between the motivations of founders and investors, it's exactly the opposite of the situation this writer describes.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3548660&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%35%34%36%36%32%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3548803 href="vote?for=3548803&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3548803></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pron">pron</a> 3 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3548803">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The author may very well be wrong about the investors' perspective and the talent-hunt motivation, but he's probably right about who's running the show, and the answer is, invariably, the big companies. Why? Because there just aren't enough successful startup IPOs to keep the entrepreneurs trying. Founders may like risks, but they're not suicidal. The only reason this show is running is that there are plenty of acquisitions at prices that appeal to both entrepreneurs and investors. So if it's big-tech that's running the show, the only question is what's in it for them. The author suggests talent, I think it's market and product research, but one way or another, if big-tech stop acquiring, the startup craze will be over within a day.<p>EDIT:<p>I guess you could say that entrepreneurs and investors are all actually working for Google or IBM or whomever, trying to find the next big thing. They're just not getting a salary but working on a commission. And once in a while, some startup may get away, do an IPO and become a real force, but that's just like an agent on commission starting his own competing business. That's a risk any employer takes.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3548803&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%35%34%36%36%32%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3548964 href="vote?for=3548964&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3548964></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 2 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3548964">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Maybe, but that startup exists in the first place only because the big companies willed it. How did that startup come to be? It got some investment money. And why did anyone invest in it? It wasn't for the hopes of an IPO because the chances are too low. The only reason that startup came to be is because the investors liked the odds of that startup being acquired. Like I said, if tomorrow morning Google, Apple, IBM, Facebook etc. decide they're not buying startups anymore but employing all developers directly and doing their own risky development, the startup scene will vanish in an instant.  So the author is right in that the startups exist to serve the big companies. The reason the big companies don't do that is that they know that true innovation flourishes under perceived freedom. So we all win, but big-tech still wins the most.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3549051&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%35%34%36%36%32%39">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3534463 href="vote?for=3534463&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3534463></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 3 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3534463">link</a> | <a href="item?id=3534430">parent</a> | on: <a href="item?id=3534430">Alabama’s immigration law is proving too strict an...</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Like any anti-Google post lately, this one has been reflexively upvoted, but if you look at his reasons for not loving Google, they're pretty thin.  The Kenyan episode was obviously one rogue branch with insufficient oversight; as soon as the guys in Mountain View found out what was going on, they stopped it, and with a minimum of the sort of corporate doublespeak you'd expect from most big companies.  The changes to privacy policies are the sort of thing hackers love to gripe about, but don't actually matter much.  (How many HN readers are going to stop using Google because of them, for example?)  All it really boils down to is that he's mad because his friend got cut off by Adsense.  And it is uncool the way Google just blows people off like that, but it's not new.  They've always been that way.  So if you didn't hate Google 5 years ago, this post offers no reason to hate them now.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3531333&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3532195 href="vote?for=3532195&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3532195></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rickmb">rickmb</a> 3 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3532195">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Pretty much every company does this.  Your phone company keeps a list of all people you call. (And happily give that list to anyone that asks nicely.) They collect information from your phone about dropped calls and keystrokes.  Retail stores move stuff around and see if it changes your buying habits.  Grocery stores track every item you buy and then have targeted ads print on your receipt.  Amazon changes the price you see based on some profile it has built on you.  Google does nothing worse than any of these companies -- when you have users, you accumulate user data.  You can just leave it lying around for the government to collect, or you can fold it into your product to make it better.  Google uses it to make their products better, and they have written policies on when the data gets anonymized and when the data gets discarded completely.  Does your phone company or grocery store do that?<p>Furthermore, Google is one of the few companies that actively tries to educate you on how they care about your privacy.  There are ads in the subway.  There are ads on TV.  There are ads (right now) on the top of every Google property.  They really want their processes to be transparent so that you know what you're signing up for when you use Google products.  It seems irrational to hate Google when every other Internet company is collecting the same data that Google is, but they hide their policies it behind 300 pages of legalese and Google buys ads to make it easier for you to understand.<p>I think there has to be some deeper issue than "they changed their privacy policy" or "my friends' pictures show up on the results page" that is causing all the Google hate.  Because it just isn't justified for the privacy policy change or Search Plus Your World.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3534498&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3534992 href="vote?for=3534992&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3534992></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=fred_nada">fred_nada</a> 3 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3534992">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>@jrockway - I know you just started at Google.  Anyway, here are the deeper issues.<p>1. I had mentioned this in another post to you before.  Anyway, some people(not all) are upset because your company said you were better than everyone else. "You can make money without being evil" "What is the best for users?"  All that crap Google said to us and continues to say like it still exists. Google was the poster child of the business of the future.  Everyone felt you were the ones that were actually going to do good.  Facebook/MS/Apple never posed as is this.  You did.  And that is where the anger comes in.  When you are told one thing and the opposite happens people get mad. They should have tried to manage expectations.<p>2. Thousands of businesses depend on your search engine.  With some of them 80% of their business comes from you whether thru paid ads or not.  Many of these companies never would have built their websites if Google didn't exist.  When your company changes things to place their irrelevant content over the content of other websites/companies people are going to be pissed.  What if Apple created their own applications for 50% of the categories in the app store and then placed their apps at the top of each category?  Wouldn't you expect some sort of anger?  Do you think Zynga would be pissed if Facebook placed all of their games higher than Zynga's games?  Its the same thing.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3534992&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3535153 href="vote?for=3535153&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3535153></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jrockway">jrockway</a> 3 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3535153">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>When you are told one thing and the opposite happens people get mad.</i><p>What is so evil about adding social networking features to everyone's account?  You have a Docs account and a Picasa account too, even if you don't use them, and nobody complains about that.  What's the difference between Docs and Google+?<p><i>Thousands of businesses depend on your search engine.</i><p>This I understand.  People are upset that they have to play with us even though they don't want to.  Nobody likes to do things that they're forced to do.  But this seems like shooting the messenger; it's not Google being evil because users won't use any search engines other than Google.  That's just loyalty to a pretty nice product.<p>Google's customers are the people that click on search results.  So while re-ranking your site may kill your business, you're not a user and that re-ranking makes the experience better for our users.  If the social cues that Google now adds are truly irrelevant as you say, they shouldn't affect users' behavior at all.  Users are not going to stop searching for something to buy just because they have to scroll the results page.  If the social features <i>are</i> relevant, though, then users are getting a better experience.  And that's a good thing, even if individual pages get less traffic from Google.  Instead of being able to SEO the entire Internet, businesses can now only affect the search results for a tiny percentage of users.  That's a good thing because SEO can't scale, and SEO isn't good for users or the Internet at large.<p>If you look at the Google experience from the standpoint of customers, it's pretty good.  Users get relevant search results and ads.  Advertisers get their content on top of everything else.  It's a good compromise between advertising and usability, and it works really well.  It's a bug that you could rank highly in Google without buying ads, and Google is trying to fix the bug.  Manipulating Google results shouldn't be something you feel entitled to be able to do.  If you want to rank highly in Google, be relevant <i>for the user currently searching</i>.  Engage him in social media or email, provide relevant information about what you're selling, and, generally, be a "good match" for what the user wants.<p><i>What if Apple created their own applications for 50% of the categories in the app store and then placed their apps at the top of each category?</i><p>They already do this.  Apple's apps are included for free on every phone.  And you aren't allowed to replicate their functionality, either. It's expectee.  Apple makes phones, Apple gets to put whatever they want on the phones.  Google makes search engine results pages, Google gets to put whatever they want on search engine results pages.<p>This isn't quite the right analogy, though.  I can see why MapQuest would be upset about Google Maps and why Yelp would be upset about Google Local.  But even in those cases, Google ranks things as you'd expect.  Yelp results often appear over the Google business pages, because Yelp is more popular for reviews.  So overall, I don't see Google as being evil.  They're being competitive and they make good products.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3535153&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3547883 href="vote?for=3547883&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3547883></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jrockway">jrockway</a> 6 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3547883">link</a></span></div><br>

Position on the results page should only depend on the quality of your content; if your site has the best content on the Internet for the user's search terms, you should be the top result.  You shouldn't be able to change your position in the organic results any other way, like by exploiting bugs in Google's ranking algorithm.  The specifics of the ranking algorithm may change, but if your site is the best, you won't have to worry about it.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3547883&whence=%69%74%65%6d%3f%69%64%3d%33%35%33%35%31%35%33">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=320></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3548229 href="vote?for=3548229&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3548229></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=thenextcorner">thenextcorner</a> 5 hours ago  | <a href="item?id=3548229">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I agree that's the most worrying sign.  In the past Google won by making what people needed.  But it seems clear that was not their primary motivation for SPYW.  Their primary motivation was clearly fear of Facebook.  That hasn't made Google evil yet.  It's just the first step down the road to mediocrity. Which may lead to evil in the long term, because to make lots of money despite being mediocre, you generally have to do evil things.<p>I don't think it's that interesting that anti-Google posts get reflexively upvoted though.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>SPYW certainly seems like the only real, new issue. It seems to me like a clear case of sacrificing a product's short-term quality for long-term quality. I.e. diverting as much traffic as possible to G+ will drive up usage, which will give Google more data on which to optimize search results.<p>It strikes me as analogous to Apple's move from OS9 to OSX. OSX performed poorly at first, but it was a necessary if painful infrastructure change for the sake of the product's future.<p>Another reason I'm not worried is that Google's only lock-in is search quality. If a challenger appears and really does perform better for searches, then people will eventually shift over. I think this is ultimately what will keep Google from going completely off the rails vis-a-vis search.<p>Conversely, I think it's what allows Facebook to get away with a lot. Its lock-in feature is ubiquity/network-effect, which is at best orthogonal to quality of product.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3531478&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3532460 href="vote?for=3532460&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3532460></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=bambax">bambax</a> 3 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3532460">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think there is a lot of "hate" for Google these days, but I believe every bodies reasoning is different.  This is OK, they have alienated so many of their users, but many in a different way.  My current "hate" for google stems from them taking the social away from Google reader,I don't give two Sh!t$ about the policies being merged, I actually think that's a good thing.  Someone else "hates" the new social merged into search.  Honestly, I enjoy diversity in the services I use online.  I want my music to be independent from my email to be independent from my "social network" (not to be confused with my "personal network", of which, email is a part of) I don't like what google has become, and if I wasn't firmly planted and reliant on gmail, I'd be google product free.  RSS, search, and cloud storage are all now solved for me elsewhere, and social always has been.  I'm sticking with gmail, because I'm not anti-google, and it's a fantastic product, but I've left google products because somethign better came along (dropbox killed any need for google docs, google killed their RSS as far as I'm concerned, and G+ never really did it for me (or any of my actual friends, although I've got thousands of followers, they're all from the HN circle...)  Did I mention that I revel in diversity to keep my mind engaged and learning new things.  I don't want my entire experience to be from google or facebooks window, I want wide open spaces of internet and applications.  If you know what I mean.<p>This is going to turn into a larger rant on the the course of "social media" and their networks.  When I'm with certain groups of friends, I act and talk in a certain way, and by no means should some of that ever be public.  I want to talk and communicate with some of the social group of mine online, but in no way shape or form should any of that be public as well.  Many people can't make that distinction (hence the UK people being deported because of tweets) and I think the big companies are trying to ruin that divide between public and private.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3534286&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3531401 href="vote?for=3531401&dir=up&whence=%74%68%72%65%61%64%73%3f%69%64%3d%70%67"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3531401></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=thaumaturgy">thaumaturgy</a> 3 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3531401">link</a></span></div><br>
