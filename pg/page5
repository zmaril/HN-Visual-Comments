<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's true I didn't write this as a source of advice for founders so much as just a report on a surprising (to me) connection I'd discovered.  But it's not useless.  It should be very useful to investors, for example, because it offers a quick way to detect which startups will succeed.  It even helped me understand the procedure we've evolved for YC interviews.  What we do during YC interviews is essentially to start YC right then, as if we'd funded them.  Now I know why that works so well.<p>It should also be useful for founders, as a warning sign to look for.  People can change, and they can also stand outside themselves to some degree.  So some founders will probably be able to read something like this and ask themselves "does this happen with us?" and if the answer is yes, to try to be less timid.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3487955 href="vote?for=3487955&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%51%5a%6c%52%36%69%30%32%42"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3487955></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=startupfounder">startupfounder</a> 14 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3487955">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's quite possible that the situation is different in academia, but in my line of work I tend to find the opposite: some of the most accomplished people are very cautious and unwilling to take strong positions without thinking them over. Usually, because they are so knowledgeable and thoughtful that they can, as soon as they start saying anything, see a million possible caveats. In the worst case that can be paralyzing, but it can also help avoid the opposite behavior: the hot-headed, confident, untimid person who just doesn't really know enough (or think over what they know) to realize why they should be more cautious about overarching claims, especially on questions that a <i>lot</i> of smart people have looked into already.<p>It's not a universal correlation, but I've generally noticed junior and less knowledgeable people (graduate students, early-career professors, etc.) to be much more brash, confident, and even aggressive in that sense than accomplished researchers, though there is a bit of an inverted-U curve (undergraduates and 1st-year graduate students tend to be very timid). Of the people I've met professionally, probably the most humble, and least willing to make strong statements without thinking them over and later offering a tentative opinion with caveats, was Bob Moog, who is also probably the smartest and most accomplished person I've met professionally.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3489051 href="vote?for=3489051&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%51%5a%6c%52%36%69%30%32%42"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3489051></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=vidarh">vidarh</a> 14 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3489051">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I agree with your assessment, and I think in many ways one of the critical parts to learn is how to assess when it is ok to "turn off" the critical eye and be brash and confident and aggressive.<p>Some of my most valuable experiences stemmed from just throwing myself in on the deep end instead of waiting to analyze all the implications. But at the same time those experiences were terribly _hard_, and carried a great deal of risk. E.g. my first company was an ISP. Started it with some friends at 19. Knew <i>nothing</i> about running a business or about setting up a large scale WAN, or about accounting, or sales, or configuring Linux servers. A year later I'd had hard, brutal and effective lessons in all of that and more.<p>If I'd spent time carefully trying to figure out the risks and implications beforehand, I doubt I'd have started that company. It didn't make me wealthy, but it was definitively worth it in terms of what I learned, and the connections I made also led directly to my next job and overall it has been pretty vital to my career.<p>On the other hand, there are many situations where not stepping back and being careful and considered and chasing down the implications up-front would've had disastrous consequences.<p>The problem isn't being cautious, if you know when not to be, but not taking action. Being cautious because you want to chase down and understand the implications is very different from being timid about addressing weaknesses in your knowledge. Whether you address those weaknesses with research or by trying is less important than avoiding paralysis.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3488369 href="vote?for=3488369&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%51%5a%6c%52%36%69%30%32%42"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3488369></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=AndyNemmity">AndyNemmity</a> 14 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3488369">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This was my experience in the interview. I felt like during the interview, I held my position too tightly rather than accept the problems that showed up. It wasn't until we left that I could really digest the problems more thoroughly, and test that advice against potential customers. I wouldn't have gotten that advice without the interview, and probably would have spent more time in the wrong direction. For me, we came to most conversations except the interview at that stage looking for advice or data, and we went to the interview looking to have an unorthodox presentation. Not only was that the wrong approach to get in, but I'm sure some of what was said to us was lost, which is unfortunate.<p>All that is a bit strange to say publicly, and is a bit of a rehash of advice given elsewhere I think. Maybe it helps somebody else though.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=0></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3486257 href="vote?for=3486257&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%51%5a%6c%52%36%69%30%32%42"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3486257></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 15 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3486257">link</a> | <a href="item?id=3486216">parent</a> | on: <a href="item?id=3485933">A Word to the Resourceful</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>At first I did worry that the problem was on my end.  That is always one's initial assumption when people don't seem to understand.  Maybe I wasn't clear enough, you think, and you try again to to explain it a different way.<p>The reason it seems unlikely that the problem is on our end is the correlation between being difficult to talk to and failure in the outside world.  If the problem was on our end, we would experience difficulty talking to both successful and unsuccessful startups.<p>Incidentally, if all you've seen is "office hours" on stage at a conference, you don't really know what office hours are like.  Office hours onstage at an event are about 1/4 as long as real office hours, and with people I've never met before.  So of course they are all over the place.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>But do you not see the flaw in that logic?  "We are not the problem so we are not going to try something else".  What advice would give if one of your groups said that?  Paul everything I have studied about you and YC over the last 5 years tells me your an incredible person but you are stubborn and you know it.  You love experiments, the next office hours simply try this approach with one of the groups.  Ask them questions and then just sit back and listen.  I know it is hard because you are an excitable guy but try it.  They look at you as an authority figure, this larger than life person who just made there dreams come true.  That holds so much power, I wonder if you realize it?  Ease that stress by leveling the playing field.  One or two meetings like this, where they feel you are actually listening, and they will be right back to your level and its business as usual.  I bet you dinner at your favorite spot that if you truly give this a chance, it will work.<p>I understand the difference and don't pretend to know the daily goings on at YC, am just putting an alternate perspective on the table for consideration.  Tonight when you reflect on this conversation, I think an idea will come to you.  I am sure this is something that bothers you very much, because you are obsessed with solving tough problems.  I think people also forget that you are human and have feelings and your not always on the top of your game.  When people are overcome with a tough process they shut off.  As you stated, that doesn't mean they don't know how or that they are not capable.  They just don't know how to get back on the right track.  These situations don't need force they need delicate leadership.  If they don't respond from there, then you have done all you can and that is all anyone could ask for.<p>I even up voted you because I know you have taken time to have this conversation.  I most likely will never get into YC because I am a single founder, therefore I fear no recourse.  When the terms are level, inspiring conversation and progress can be made.  I appreciate that you have listened to me and considered my thoughts, as someone trying to reach a goal, that means very much!<p>Think about this conversation and then what I just said, the answer is right there staring at you my friend.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3486635 href="vote?for=3486635&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%51%5a%6c%52%36%69%30%32%42"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3486635></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jbooth">jbooth</a> 15 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3486635">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think we would all agree, none of our communication is ever flawless, including mine. I also think that from PG position he can only hold peoples hands for so long until they have to be big boys and get on there own feet and get there ass in gear.  For all those who have played sports, great coaches treat different players differently based on how they best respond and that allows them to get the maximum effort from their talent.  All I am offering in this thread is maybe there is something more that can be done from a new angle, for both PG and the founders growth and a solution to make the YC process even better.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3486714 href="vote?for=3486714&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%51%5a%6c%52%36%69%30%32%42"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3486714></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jbooth">jbooth</a> 15 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3486714">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>From the discussion here, I conclude this quote is widely accepted among those who provide quality discourse: "I try to comment when I have useful, unique, original, or non-standard things to say."  This represents a desire to deliver a certain promised value.  When you post on a forum, (or send an email, for that matter) you are making an implicit claim: is worth the audience's time to read your post.<p>For users like me, there is friction in posting because I have to convince myself that I've satisfied the implicit claim.  For others, I assume, this friction is absent.  So add it artificially: somehow make the claim explicit.<p>Maybe require posters to select from a list of categories (e.g. Useful Information, Insightful, Civil Disagreement, ...), explicitly claiming their post meets that criteria.  Or, less restrictive: a required checkbox that simply reminds you of the claim you're making with your post.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3470278 href="vote?for=3470278&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%51%5a%6c%52%36%69%30%32%42"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3470278></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Jabbles">Jabbles</a> 18 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3470278">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Quickly checking in to respond, as the "extremely active 4 year old account" in question...<p>The comment was clearly poorly phrased. When I made it, there were no negative comments on the story, and it was really just intended to question the "programmer prodigy" aspect, not to criticise the deceased or imply that she was not an impressive young person.<p>I hate (!) to discard any part of the english language; I think all expressions have their place, including "I hate to be that guy, but" - however, in hindsight, the net effect was to lump my relatively neutral comment in with all the haters on the thread, so, in practice, it was proven to be a poor choice.<p>That said, I do dislike the habit of idolising deceased people as perfect in every way. It reminds me of the "HN Salesmanship hero" story (where I commented that he wasn't my hero and I resented this attribution, for which I got badly downvoted). This person was clearly impressive without making stuff up about them. From all the comments and interviews, it in fact seems that her programming ability, far from being prodigy-like, was in fact the least impressive of her other personal traits.<p>To conclude: had I known that there would be a pile-up of hateful belittling following my comment, I wouldn't have made it, or if I felt the need to ask that question, I would have done so in a much more carefully phrased way. I fully take the blame for not realising that this type of thread could descend down to that level, but my intention was certainly not to belittle.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3472081 href="vote?for=3472081&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%51%5a%6c%52%36%69%30%32%42"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3472081></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dkarl">dkarl</a> 18 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3472081">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Maybe a little bit more understanding is due all around.  If I can divide the world into two caricatured groups, we have:<p>"I can never stop feeling, but sometimes I'm too tired to think" -- rallying around the asinine "prodigy" headline.<p>"I can never stop thinking, but sometimes I'm too tired to feel" -- rallying around the emotionally tone-deaf responses.<p>I think we all tend to identify with one side more than the other, but instead of rallying our<i>selves</i> on either side of the issue, we should see each side as a vital aspect of being human that each of us has, with one side often gaining the upper hand and then getting out of hand.  If we want to measure the supposed "decline" of Hacker News by the fact that one side gets out of hand and provokes a response the other, I think both sides need to be held to account.  Glurge begets callousness.  A pervasive environment of callousness makes glurge seem like a welcome relief.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>One thing a lack of anonymity forces you to do is to present your entire feelings about a story, instead of the one point that you feel is missing or needs correction.  When people present points in isolation, it's easy to get the wrong impression about how they feel.<p>I didn't comment in the thread under discussion, but if I felt there was one <i>point</i> that needed to be added to the original story, it was the one made by many posters, roughly, "This smells like glurge, and when people are mourning for an inspiring little girl, it's common sense not to take what they say about her at face value."  Of course that wouldn't reflect my whole reaction as a human being.<p>And that's the difference between reacting as a non-anonymous human being, where you are careful to present your <i>whole</i> feelings about a topic, and reacting as a member of a message board, where you're like to dismiss most of what you think and feel as commonplace and not worth mentioning.<p>Like any problem in communication, it's a problem of readers as well as writers.  Reading a message from "asdf1234" or "prgrmrd00d4u" (not real names AFAIK) and reading it as representative of a human being's feelings doesn't make any sense, but it's irresistible for a lot of people.  If the nerds on Slashdot and HN can't resist parsing comments that way, I think it's time to give up and accept that as human beings we can only see each other as whole human beings and not merely as contributors to a conversation.  So the burden of solving this communication problem is on the writers to act like whole human beings.<p>The primary psychological resistance -- and believe me, I do rebel against being "human" on a discussion board with every bit of my being -- comes from the fact that most of us would prefer to sound more like scientists than like politicians.  Scientists say, "Here is my tiny marginal contribution."  Politicians say, "This is who I am."  Geeks roll their eyes when a politician answering a question about tax policy in a debate spends all of his allotted time talking about how much he loves his children and then caps it off with half a sentence stating his position on the issue.  We hate that and don't want to be like that.  We want to hear how he differs from his opponents.  We don't want to hear everything he has in common with everyone else.  We want the <i>diff</i>.<p>Our humanity is what we have in common, exactly what is excluded when we present ourselves as a diff.  If you read the original discussion and read every comment as a diff, then you don't see comments by inhuman people.  You see whole human beings whose common humanity was redacted by the diff filter running between their brains and their keyboards.<p>Maybe the need to relax that diff filter a little bit so we all sound like human beings needs to be part of a FAQ somewhere....</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3472640 href="vote?for=3472640&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%74%51%5a%6c%52%36%69%30%32%42"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3472640></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=prodigal_erik">prodigal_erik</a> 18 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3472640">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It was the same way with my startup. I had no idea how Hollywood or fashion worked, but I had a problem [1] and when I asked people if they knew how to solve it, they just gave me back a similar problem they once had [2]. At that point, I figured this was a good company to build.<p>If it's even possible, the entertainment and fashion industries may require even <i>more</i> schlepping than the banking industry. Instead of dealing with lots of regulation and paperwork, now you're frequently dealing with self-obsessed, anti-technology narcissists who are completely unwilling to help you do anything.<p>But we muddled through and did the work that everyone else doesn't want to do.
