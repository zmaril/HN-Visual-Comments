<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>What worries me more is bad (= mean and/or stupid) comments that actually get upvoted.</i><p>Thanks for explaining what data points you and the curation team observe closely, and what trends you have noticed. You mentioned above about the goal of increasing comment quality that "There's a lot we already do about it, and probably other techniques that are yet undiscovered. This is somewhat uncharted territory." I'll renew a suggestion here that I think would be helpful.<p>I've been a moderator one place or another online since 1993, and I've seen a lot of online discussion forums attempt to acculturate newbies to civil, thoughtful discussion. One of the most helpful practices that I have observed over the years is making sure that people who use factual assertions to back a position in a discussion are accountable for where one would look up the facts to verify them and ensure they are not made up. (A HUGE percentage of all real-world discourse about controversial issues is based on made-up factual premises.) With that in mind, I'm trying to encourage a culture here of asking people for sources when they make a factual assertion, and providing sources in a first comment when there sources on the issue. (I try to stud most of my comments with links to sources to exemplify this.) So any time any of us see a comment that is dumb, an essential thing to do is to ask the person who made the dumb comment what the basis for the comment is. ("Do you have a source for that?" or the more abrupt "[citation needed]" as occasion demands, or "What about [detail of assertion]?" if that is better for raising the quality of the discussion.) Another thing to do is to share the growing online literature about evaluating sources, such as my very favorite link for Hacker News discussions,<p><a href="http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html" rel="nofollow">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>and links about constructive online participation.<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html</a><p>A lot of stupid comments (and, alas, I have a particular user's example in mind) result from the convenience of reading blogs rather than reading serious scholarly literature. And the paywalls around serious scholarly articles only exacerbate this problem. So I routinely upvote any comment that points to a reliable source, and especially comments that teach other HN participants how to find and access reliable sources.<p>In general, promoting an information-based culture here will have two effects that will help reduce the problem of dumb comments: (1) it will raise the karma and visibility of the better comments that include good information from reliable sources (or that ask for that as follow-ups to worse comments), and (2) it will be off-putting to people inclined to make it up when they are put to their proof for the things they say.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3499195&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3498535 href="vote?for=3498535&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3498535></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=redthrowaway">redthrowaway</a> 11 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3498535">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's clear why this happens. The people interested in fuzzy, quasi-political or "outrage" issues are passionately engaged with them.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I don't think it's really an issue of <i>passion</i>. Rather, it is an issue of demographics: almost everybody is affected or at least mildly interested in politics; only smaller subsets of the population are interested in Haskell/Erlang/complexity/aglorithms...etc. Frankly, I bet some people are as "passionate" (for a loose definition of "passionate") about, say, functional programming as others are about politics; there are just more people with at least a casual interest in the latter than the former.<p>Also, as HN gets more readers, it becomes more diverse. I've seen doctors, medical students, lawyers...etc post. It's no surprise somebody like that is going to skip a post about using abstract mathematics to model programming or about optimizing lunch at your startup; they are probably gravitating towards the political articles. On the other hand, just being interested in start-ups and CS does not preclude looking at politics.<p>So really, I think this is a function of diversity: in a purely democratic system--everybody has an equal vote--less specialized things really have an advantage. This is why I don't bother reading the newspaper or front page of reddit, but still enjoy /r/haskell.<p>I'm sure there are also plenty of confounding variables; I just think it's more broad appeal than passion. (Seriously, have you read the responses to people's blindly disparaging functional programming? At least as passionate as most political posts ;).)</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3498493&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3498652 href="vote?for=3498652&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3498652></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rbanffy">rbanffy</a> 11 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3498652">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There are geopolitical/economics issues that are as important to hackers as algorithms. This past week, of SOPA, PIPA, OPEN, ACTA and other less beloved acronyms are of at least some interest for hackers because they directly impact our ability to hack things, to the point of having pg reminding us that the long-entrenched entertainment industry is ripe for disruptive innovation.<p>Here we find people of diverse tastes. I am an engineer and, given the possibility, I'd be designing processor architectures and instruction sets. I also like programming - and do it for a living, but I have lost some of my taste for algorithms and data structures and prefer to generate competitive differentials elsewhere on the stack. But I am also very worried by the political background, both here in South America, where I live, in Europe, where my ancestors came from, and with the US, which is a very fine country where a lot of dear friends live and that we shouldn't allow to be ruined by a bunch of crazy people. When I was a teenager, I read 1984 and the idea something like that could happen scared me a lot. It still does. Bad politics is contagious.<p>I think all is fine, as long as we remain civilized and don't forget to disagree in constructive ways. Community and relationships are important too - I have only one nickname, after all, one which is easily identifiable. All my friends know who I am, where I came from and what my opinions tend to be.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>===== Why It Happens Theory #1 - "Community Size Syndrome" ====
I am guilty of this. And I think I know why I/we do it. When a topic comes up, and you feel your voice isn't/won't be heard, it tends to make you over-emote, yell, and stomp though the place to get more attention / vent frustration.<p>Think about it. It wasn't like this when Hacker News was smaller, because when HN was smaller there were less people, less comments, and everyone had a voice that could be heard. Now that the place is bigger your "voice" is easily lost, your comment ends up at the bottom, you feel like your opinion won't matter. This stresses you out and pisses you off so you go and piggyback off of someone else's comment near the top and just vent.<p>We see this in political ralleys, demonstrations, protests. When humans feel they are NOT being listened to, they get loud and angry.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3498482&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3498287 href="vote?for=3498287&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3498287></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=chc">chc</a> 11 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3498287">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think these are related. The kind of people who like to comment on some things — say, politics — <i>tend to be</i> less tactful. This drags the average down. Then, unless you're very lucky, people readjust their norms and start acting ruder themselves — and then you have yourself a vicious circle. I've seen it happen in a lot of places. It makes me sad every time.<p>I'd strongly suggesting policing OT posts more proactively.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I am not sure that the moderation is aggressive* enough to shape the growth that the site is experiencing. I feel like the smartest most insightful people in the community should be being more decisive in their flagging/moderation/conversation. You can non-aggressively tell somebody to not be rude and I don't see that happening...<p>Perhaps something should be done to alter the direction that the content is moving, too. I personally agree with tptacek that gossipy advocacy/techpolitic issues are now far too important to the site. I enjoyed them a little, too, but I feel like the community is now addicted to them. Honestly I don't want to see anymore gossip pieces from torrentfreak...<p>* For example, (1) give people limits on how often they can post while their average karma is low, (2) allow people to flag for more reasons (hivemind posts, aggressive posts, bigotry, rudeness), (3) give people a couple of weeks/months to time-out from the site if they get flagged and there turns out to be a problem with their behaviour. I think there is a danger on a site like this of people over-complicating the problem when there are simple things you can try. :)</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3498449&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3498227 href="vote?for=3498227&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3498227></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=citricsquid">citricsquid</a> 12 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3498227">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The problem is one I've experienced too on forums I both use and operate. The larger the community grows the less respect people have for each other because there's so little "connection" between them, the more people become "combative" to be heard and the more people feel the need to be more "vicious" with the way that they post. There is no way to limit this beyond restrictions of the people that post and the community size, in an environment with conflicting opinions it's inevitable.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>A few years ago, posting on HN felt like posting to a small community. Reputation and civility seemed to matter a lot. When people posted something offensive or rude, they were sanctioned to the point that they would often delete the offending comment. (I remember deleting a comment I made on an old account merely because, without tone, it seemed inflammatory; I felt compelled to delete it even though it had no malicious intent because it damaged the conversation.)<p>Now, I think it has become too large and feels anonymous. Posting something offensive has no cost because it doesn't feel like a "know your neighbor"-type community anymore. The costs imposed by karma seem to be less significant. I even think that if you post a rude or ideologically motivated comment, there are other rude people who will agree with you, attenuating the negative signal.<p>The HN is turning to reddit mime is genuine. I think it's just a consequence of having a very large community. Although a lot of HNers may disagree, I think the herd must be culled. <i>I'd be happier of participation was limited</i>. If I was the benevolent dictator, I'd collect a list of people whose contributions are most valuable and remove everyone else. Then, give those high-signal / low-noise contributors the ability to invite other people. Continue to have all content publicly readable, but ration the writes.<p>(Disclaimer: Although I have many doubts, I do believe it is possible to have an HN-scale community that remains civil; however, without the data, I'm not very comfortable just enumerating implementation ideas.)</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3498391&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3501446 href="vote?for=3501446&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3501446></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=polyfractal">polyfractal</a> 11 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3501446">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>On behalf of authors everywhere, please don't use the flag button as a downvote button. This, for several reasons:<p>1. It's overpowered. Based on some experiments I conducted a year or so ago, it seems like 1-2 flags equal about 10-20 places dropped in the rankings. It's brutal. A single person in a bad mood can drop a story like a stone. I don't know the exact maths, but a single flag seems to have the effect of many downvotes.<p>2. It's not what it was designed for! According to the guidelines, flagging is meant to be for "spam or offtopic", not for stuff you don't like or disagree with and want to downvote. If you disagree with it, write a comment to explain why, or find a comment that agrees with your disagreement and upvote that. Flagging is not a way to express disagreement!<p>3. It's mean. I regularly get articles on the front page, and I don't care <i>that</i> much what happens to them (though of course I like to see the discussion they generate!), but once upon a time I did, and I'm sure that's still the case for many. When you put your heart and soul into an article, and it miraculously got picked up by HN, and it's on the front page, and people are finally checking out your blog, and it's getting more visitors in one hour than it had in the last 6 months... and you see the story suddenly vanish to the second page because someone flagged it... wow, that feels like a punch to the stomach. So please don't flag "real" articles, only flag spam/trash.<p>If you think an article sucks, post a comment to explain why you think so. Maybe you misunderstood. In any case, the feedback will be clearer. Please don't use the flagging sledgehammer to express disagreement.<p>(note: I don't know if pg would agree with the above, but these are my feelings)</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3497721&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3498064 href="vote?for=3498064&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3498064></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Ives">Ives</a> 12 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3498064">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You may not be able to control them, but you can <i>influence</i> who YC startups do business with.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The original post ends by asking the wrong - and an extremely limiting - question.<p>Technological innovations of camera/film/projectors (and later broadcast &#38; receivers) made motion pictures <i>possible</i>. These came first. The current "Hollywood" production-distribution-revenue model came after, as a result of the economics of what it took to make motion pictures <i>profitable</i>. So, "Hollywood" is less the entertainment, and more the means by which that entertainment is produced and distributed.<p>Therefore, if one wants to "Kill Hollywood", one doesn't doesn't do it by asking merely "What's the most entertaining thing you can build?" One does it by changing the economics in a way that renders "Hollywood", at least in terms of current studios-distributors-theaters (and studios-channels-Xcasters) model, untenable.<p>The question to entrepreneurs that the original post <i>should</i> have concluded with is "What can you make that makes making and distributing engrossing entertainment (whatever form that may take) cheaper/easier/more accessible/more capable/more profitable/more easily funded?"<p>Unless your interest does lie specifically in investing in the entertaining things. Cool. Innovative entertainment may result, but I wouldn't expect any of those investments to result in the thing that "kills Hollywood".</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3493028&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3493186 href="vote?for=3493186&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3493186></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=foxit">foxit</a> 13 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3493186">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>This post nails it.  You're talking about disrupting two things, neither of which are entertainment:  distribution of finished goods (external), and the system within that's been in place since the fall of the studio system in the '60s (internal).  Neither of these things have <i>that</i> much to do with entertainment.  Technology has made being a filmmaker far, far cheaper than it used to be even in the heyday of indie film in the 90s, though there is still a high financial barrier to entry to pay for all the quality things you need on a set (oh, an idea!).  Entertainers absolutely embrace innovation, both creative and technological.  It's structures that don't.<p>Here's two specific targets: Creative Artists Agency and the Screen Actors Guild.  Good luck.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3493186&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3495463 href="vote?for=3495463&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3495463></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=foxit">foxit</a> 12 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3495463">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I have two general ideas.  Steal them.  I don't have time to implement.<p>1)  Find innovative ways to reduce production costs.  Production is expensive.  Unimaginably so.  This can be things like:
a)  Redesign physical set equipment.  Ex: Set lights are expensive; a single light can cost tens of thousands of dollars.  Design a new light that takes advantage of modern LEDs or something, or that can be deconstructed to serve multiple lighting functions (beyond what exists today).  
b)  Design automation to replace physical support crew on the set.  Payroll is an enormous cost.  Ex: Invent a tracking system that would make the boom mic not require a person to physically move it around to follow the actors.  Yes, mechanization would eliminate jobs - such is the nature of creative destruction.  
c)  Innovation in use of set design and photography to make things look much more expensive than they are.  A shining example of this was how Orson Welles shot Citizen Kane.  Another example is what Spielberg did with the nonfunctional shark in Jaws.  For those two, you're probably going to have to check out a book to learn how they did it.  And more recently the impressive-looking but cheap sets and photography in Underworld (2003).  These directors did unbelievably good things with constraints.  Find a way to systemize this.  To study what could be made cheaper, look at films that cost way too much, and see how each shot could've been cut down to bare bones - the absolute minimum dollar amount required to make the exact same look and effect.<p>The most choking example of waste I've ever personally witnessed was on the set of Van Helsing (2004) in Prague.  The entirety of Old Town Square was cleared, about a hundred security held people out around the perimeter, and giant cranes and lights lit a scene of Hugh Jackman leaping in the air.  What was the end product that appeared in the movie, you ask?  A two-second shot of Jackman leaping in the air above some cobblestone.  The whole thing could've been accomplished on a 10' by 10' mockup of cobblestone in a studio, or a cobblestone street somewhere cheaper to rent the entirety of than the Old Town Square of Prague.<p>2)  As mentioned elsewhere in this thread, marketing costs are gargantuan.  You have to get eyeballs on your enjoyable entertainment.  
I watch independent film.  The difficulty of going into a little-known film, even one that's received some good notice, is that I generally don't know a thing about it.  
People enjoy trailers.  Create trailers.  Once production is complete, making a trailer for it is essentially free - it requires the software you used to edit the film and your own time and effort.  
Run strings of trailers for unknown films on IFC.  Run a 30-minute block of 30 to 45 second teasers with links to the film's site, where you have the 2 1/2 minute trailer and more information.  Get eyeballs on productions.  Right now getting eyeballs on productions is forbiddingly expensive.  Revolutionize it.  Cheapen it.<p>I don't think innovating other entertainment will kill Hollywood any faster.  You have to innovate the film industry itself.  Every human culture throughout history has enjoyed watching performers enact a story, of some kind or another.  Moving pictures of performers enact a story isn't going anywhere in popularity.  There's a reason it's such a profitable industry.  Technology has advanced to the state it's in today where moving pictures of performers enacting stories are easily viewed the world over, but I don't think you should think about changing the type of entertainment so much as the mechanics of the medium.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3495463&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3497037 href="vote?for=3497037&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3497037></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=DanHulton">DanHulton</a> 12 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3497037">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I read halfway through point number 1 and I thought "robotize the studio."  Think of a new studio that is infinitely configurable with lights and cameras, and all controlled by software. Kind of a Holodeck but in reverse, or a blackbox theatre where the point is to record everything that goes on in the studio and configure that recording, maybe even something similar to a 3D scanner but with full motion cameras.  3D Models and location overlays could be inserted more easily because all the details of the original shots are already recorded, and can be adjusted after shooting.<p>What this is would be a standardized studio room, that would only require the director and actors on set.  Every other specialty could be done in post, and thus allow them to work on more projects at once.  Better skilled people, doing more work, drives quality up and lower costs.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I agree that the question is limiting, but not necessarily wrong. By creating a new form of entertainment, one can take over a portion of Hollywood's revenue pie and that in a way will create havoc for Hollywood, but not necessarily killing Hollywood since there will be bound to be people who likes Hollywood productions (especially since Hollywood has the finance to fund multi-million dollar productions in a whim).<p>What Hollywood fails to do is to listen to the voices of common people like me and you. Over and over again, Hollywood has produced films that fail to deliver and blame it on piracy. The point is that there will still be people who wants to reward quality content (or at least this is what I believe) and there needs to be a way for current technology to show this.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>The video game industry is indeed bigger than Hollywood but that doesn't mean that it cannot become any bigger to harm Hollywood. As long as the content is engaging and fun for viewers, it will eventually eat into Hollywood's revenue pie.<p>I believe that currently, in order to "kill" Hollywood, the first step is to shrink the role of the middlemen by enabling content creators to distribute and market their content effectively online. In fact, the internet has provided a great way to do just that (it is the perfect distribution and marketing channel)! All of us are constantly sharing and reproducing the content and this helps expose users with all sorts of content. Now if there is a startup which focuses on "following" and "chasing" the content and sell products related to the content itself, I believe that many users will buy the products that interest them. For instance, when we watch "Mission Impossible" we may be interested in the music tracks, the movie DVD, the clothes that the characters are wearing, toys &#38; merchandises etc. If more products are being sold, this is a reflection of the quality of the content itself. Product companies would then want to sponsor and fund for quality content creators to carry on producing content. Apart from that such a platform may allow more quality content to be placed on Youtube where users are abundant!<p>The next step is to make content interactive. PG mention "what are people going to do for fun in 20 years instead of what they do now?" and I thought of the notion of having the viewers of the content to dictate the direction of the show and making the content engaging that it makes me feel like I am part of it. Currently in many games (esp rpg) I decide the route/path that the character follows and this leads to different game endings. This can be applied to movies as well. A movie can have 4 parts and after each part, the movie may request me to buy a certain choice (eg. the character has 3 roads to choose, which do you choose and this will dictate the progression of the story) or product (there are 3 guns to choose, buy 1 from your local store lol! and key in product keycode or something). This can tie in very well with the idea on paragraph 1 where product companies can help sponsor for the video production.<p>What do you think about these ideas? I am working on idea 1 and I would be keen for some feedback and would love for people to contribute to this startup.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm not sure if this thread is dead at this point, but I want to put forward my suggestion to founders.  What you should really be trying to to do, is found a new AIP or New World Pictures.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman#.22The_Corman_Film_School.22" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Corman#.22The_Corman_Film...</a><p>You want to create a place dedicated to locating and attracting young talent (directors, writers, actors, and producers) that's capable of producing high volumes of low cost product.  You want to design a golden era Hollywood studio for the modern age.<p>This studio would have two main components.  Production and distribution.  The production side is essentially a no brainer.  You grow a pool of talent, and you keep that talent working 8 days a week, producing a diverse slate of low cost filmed entertainment on an aggressive schedule.  Ideally, pictures would take 12 days to shoot, and would have budgets in the thousands instead of the millions.  You'd be producing so many stories, that you could afford to make them highly specialized in their appeal - you wouldn't have to generate "four quad" films, you could instead afford to cater to smaller audiences but satisfy those smaller audiences more completely.  People have tuned off Hollywood films in the last decade because those films have become too focused on mass market appeal - in having "something for everyone" they have instead produced stories with something for no one.  The idea of our hypothetical studio is to reverse that trend.  Tell stories that only appeal to select audiences, but REALLY appeal to those audiences.<p>This leads to the second half of our hypothetical studio (and frankly, being a filmmaker and not a businessman, the half that I have less competence with): distribution.  This would in fact be the more critical and difficult component of the company to build, because it would be the side dedicated to identifying, locating, and reaching those smaller, more specialized audiences.  Our creative talent - the writers, directors and actors - tells the stories, and our distribution team gets those stories in front of the right audiences.  It wouldn't take long for a deep and sustaining feedback loop to develop between the two halves of our studio - close communication with our audiences would give the creators more guidance in learning what works and what doesn't on screen, leading to better stories which would grow a more dedicated audience or fan base.  In their own ways, this is what Kevin Smith and Joss Whedon have done by reaching out to and learning from their fan bases.<p>The hypothetical studio I've outlined is exactly what golden age studios did to great effect before theater ownership became a losing battle and the star system began to crumble.  In the modern era, we have the advantage of dramatically lowered distribution costs - a computer in every home - but the disadvantage of a greater signal to noise ratio.  But this system - small studios producing a high volume of targeted stories at low cost - has proved repeatable and profitable.  You could make the argument that Corman, with AIP and New World Pictures, saved Hollywood filmmaking during the New Hollywood period by using exactly the system I've outlined above to locate and nurture new talent while maintaining a high profitability.<p>So anyways.  That's what I think.  We shouldn't be focused on producing a new form of entertainment.  As consumers, we don't really need or want a new medium; the bump and decline of 3D sales has proved this, I think.  Novelty only carries you so far.  What is needed is instead a more economically savvy model, focused on generating stories geared towards smaller audiences that will embrace those stories more passionately.  We need a studio that will take as it's battle cry "We'd rather be nine people's favorite thing than 100 people's ninth favorite thing."

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You’re an ass.<p>Pardon the bluntness of that statement but I’m home right now because this pissed me off so much.  So my tone is less measured.  Have you even contemplated all the things the industry you’re trying to “kill” does?<p>Make note of something: Hollywood is one of the most unionized workforces in the United States.   This isn’t a story of rich studio heads taking advantage of people.  Actors, Writers, Stage Hands, Directors, and just about everyone else in Hollywood is in a union of some kind and there’s a reason for that.<p>Creativity is random and creative people can’t count on steady work.  So they need equitable pay to survive.<p>There’s an organization called Chanel 101 in LA.  It’s basically a bunch of creative people showing their work (they put the stuff online if you want to google it).  What the great majority of these people have in common is they work in the industry.  Not as actors or writers but as stagehands, clerks and other low level positions.  They are the people fighting their way up through the system and the system is designed to support them while they do.  
The system you’re trying to kill is what keeps those people alive.  What puts food on their table so they can keep working towards their dreams.  Because they aren’t programmers.  They can’t go out and get an $85,000 a year day job that allows them to live comfortably while they tinker on a startup in their spare time.<p>The studio system, as obnoxious as it is, exists for a reason.  It’s an equilibrium that’s developed over decades of creating media.  Every few years you’ll see a famous actor form their own studio yet those studios always end up playing by the same rules as the existing studios.  Because it’s still roughly the most equitable system available (and if you don’t believe that you should feel free to try and start your own studio)<p>Yes, the media industry can help to create stupid laws.  I don’t deny that.  But it isn’t because they’re evil or mean.  For the most part it’s because these companies are run by 60 year old men who don’t understand the nuances of technology.   But their intentions are good.  Their intention is to keep money on the table of all those creative people.  To keep paying residuals to actors who might not find work for years at a time.  To keep funding movies where there’s no guarantee of profit and keep all those stagehands, clerks, and so on employed.<p>It is quite frankly unconscionable for a millionaire to lead a bunch of people who can make over $100,000 a year in an effort to kill off the industry that’s paying all the folks who make less than $30,000.<p>(Let the down votes commence)</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3492889&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3492928 href="vote?for=3492928&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3492928></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 13 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3492928">link</a></span></div><br>

Best case scenario for a startup is to spark a totally new niche and find a totally new audience, but this is rare. Most startups just end up replacing brick and mortar businesses of old and eating their paying customer base. This is economics at its finest, and most definitely leads to a poor outcome for the businesses which are cannibalized.<p>Labeling people as "good" and "bad" is a futile exercise. Capitalism is a mad scramble to extract wealth from everyone else as fast as possible, with whatever means necessary. To do this lawfully, you usually need to provide some value to paying customers. However, many businesses do it by simply convincing customers that they are receiving value, and do very well (e.g. Zynga).<p>From the tone of your article, it appears you have just understood that this system will lead to severe wealth inequality spanning orders of magnitude. This is again, a perfectly well understood outcome of the system. The societal and moral ramifications have been largely ignored due to the imbalance of power between owners of capital and those without. Thus, to have a say in the game, one must play it, and become very successful (i.e. a billionaire). In the process of becoming a billionaire, you will find that your views on this matter will change very rapidly in tandem with your net worth. Before you know it, you are advocating for less capital gains tax, more free trade and reduced government. You will see those Occupy Wall St. protesters as pathetic hooligans and low lives, who simply lack the motivation and willpower to make something of themselves. You will petition congress to protect your business interests, and pay handsomely to do so. You will support politicians who maintain order and those who crack down fiercely on all forms of business which are in direct competition to your own. If you are a film industry exec, you will lobby very hard (with SOPA and PIPA, perhaps) against new distribution channels such as Megavideo, Piratebay, etc. which give content away without due royalties. You will be apathetic to anyone who does not understand how this world works, particularly those with low or no net worth who have no say in these important decisions.<p>Welcome to the game of life. There are very few winners, and most people are losers. The only salvation for the losers is ignorance; to understand the game is to hate it.

Kill the industry empowers people to do other things like pirate media because "this is war".  But if people do that then even the honest media execs can't keep their business afloat.<p>On a larger note the issue is with our society becoming so hateful.<p>This is a little off topic but in 1918 Manfred Von Rechtoven  , also known as the Red Baron, was shot down and killed behind enemy lines.  At the time his record stood at around 80 kills (more than anyone else by far).  And here (from Wikipedia) is what the Allied forces did...<p>----<p>In common with most Allied air officers, Major Blake, who was responsible for Richthofen's remains, regarded the Red Baron with great respect, and he organised a full military funeral, to be conducted by the personnel of No. 3 Squadron AFC.<p>Richthofen was buried in the cemetery at the village of Bertangles, near Amiens, on 22 April 1918. Six airmen with the rank of Captain—the same rank as Richthofen—served as pallbearers, and a guard of honour from the squadron's other ranks fired a salute. Allied squadrons stationed nearby presented memorial wreaths, one of which was inscribed with the words, "To Our Gallant and Worthy Foe".<p>----<p>Look at that in comparison with all the hatred and anger around here directed at the record companies and you can see why I find it so disturbing.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3493137&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3494556 href="vote?for=3494556&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3494556></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dcosson">dcosson</a> 13 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3494556">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I can see where you're coming from, but I have to disagree.   For one thing, I think you're reading too much into the word kill.  In the the startup vernacular you always hear things like "company X promises to be the Y killer", and I really don't think "kill" in this context has any kind of mean-spirited undertones.  It's just business.  (Perhaps you'd like to make an etymological argument about the connotations of startup/business terminology being unnecessarily hateful, but that's irrelevant to the argument here).<p>As for your earlier point that disrupting Hollywood would mean replacing thousands of people with $30K jobs with hundreds with $150K jobs, that may very well be what happens.  But the same argument could be made of any industry that gets infused technology or new ideas.  Instead of taking such a reactionary approach and fighting to keep a seemingly dying industry alive just for the sake of the status quo, why not have a more productive discussion and think of real ways that the sometimes corrupt and, more importantly, no longer effective Hollywood model can be improved?  Whether or not it comes from a trendy new YC-funded startup, it certainly seems like it's coming.<p>Personally, I find the idea of technological growth to the point of a "singularity" in the coming decades pretty compelling, and I think one of the biggest challenges we as a society will face is maintaining employment rates as technology continues to make things more and more efficient.  Protecting those on the lower rungs in Hollywood and the music industry is certainly an important part of this.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3494556&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=240></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3493166 href="vote?for=3493166&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3493166></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Natsu">Natsu</a> 13 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3493166">link</a></span></div><br>

But the French Revolution wasn't an easy or pretty process.<p>You don't have to centrally plan the creative destruction of Hollywood.  This is like arguing we can't cut overseas military spending because think of the jobs we will lose.<p>What would you replace slavery with?  What about internal combustion engines?  Replacing these things aren't easy, more people will suffer in the short-term.  But guess what?  People are suffering now, and society as a whole rots because we squander the opportunity to use TV and film to enliven people's minds, instead we just want to empty their pocketbooks by any means possible.<p>I worked as an executive in Hollywood.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Follow the logic here.  Denying Netflix content for a little longer might hurt Netflix because people will come to Netflix during that time, look for the content, and not find it.  So if that's true wouldn't it just be easier to never give Netflix the content.  I mean, if they're trying to kill Netflix that would seem the way to go.<p>The truth is they aren't trying to kill Netflix they're trying to maximize profit which is what every company does.  They are delaying movies to Netflix because they've found people will buy the movies from iTunes during that time period.<p>If that will kill Netflix it's their job to say "hey, we're a revenue stream for you and we're going to go away if you delay these movies" and then a negotiation will ensue.  This is how capitalism works with each company trying to make as much money as they can and companies negotiating with each other to do so.<p>Having said that I've always believed media should be treated as a monopoly and regulated accordingly.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>On the topic of residuals and the intentions of studios ("Their intention is to keep money on the table of all those creative people. To keep paying residuals to actors who might not find work for years at a time."):<p>First, in 2007 the CEO of Warner Bros., among others, called for an end to residuals [0]. Second, studios are notorious for creative accounting which results in people with residuals on "net" profit being paid nothing; for instance, one of the Harry Potter movies grossed $938 million worldwide but "lost" $167 million [1], [2] The latter link cites a court saying the way Hollywood determines pay for authors was "unconscionable" (I wish its citation was to a source that's online). And third, I don't have a reference at hand for this one because I heard this on NPR years ago, but there was a trial where a studio accountant was questioned about the accuracy of movie profit statements, and he said that in his entire career he'd never seen a single movie where the accounting was accurate.<p>[0] <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/11/business/media/11cnd-guild.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/11/business/media/11cnd-guild...</a>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Two things:<p>1: give it a rest, you've made yr point and been voted appropriately.<p>2: do not compare killing hollywood akin to invading another country. You're pushing the point off on to a tangent that does nothing to serve the conversation.<p>That said, I'm 100% for 'killing hollywood'. Their arguments are bullshit and their lobbying efforts just go to show how corrupt the system has become. How does the mpaa/riaa/copyright cartels equate to "we the people" at all? These cartels hide behind the shield of "jobs will be lost" when in reality, we all know this is just a line of bullshit and translates into 'we need to maintain our dying industry'.<p>I agree wholeheartedly with the 'pirates', non-pirates, normal folks, etc, when they say kill the dying beast. The world will not end if Spielberg or Lucas can't make another movie again or Metallica can't put out another cd. These are incumbents who have nothing to contribute to society anymore and are living off their legacy.<p>These industries cripple innovative progress for the common good of all people. They are beyond corrupt in their tactics, government inflict, and like Marco says, they really do hate us. The system has been unfairly been tipped to their favor by money. Because of this, and as an artist myself, I have no problem with people downloading and distributing whatever they want. I'd much rather have an Internet that still works and a thriving society than a society in the iron grip of a few select groups and milked for every cent they have.<p>Besides taking action like we've done against sopa, we also need to remember to vote with our wallets when needed.<p>Please, kill hollywood and the music industries as they exist now.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3494429&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3492908 href="vote?for=3492908&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3492908></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=temphn">temphn</a> 13 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3492908">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>As a 30 year game industry vet I have to say I agree with you... but... maybe games that depend less on the controller will capture BOTH of your attentions.<p>I'll give you an example.  At a board game company, I do those too, I proposed a card game where playing the cards moved the story along, and each section of the story formed pages in a comic book format.  At the end of the game you could take pictures o the "pages" and put them for others to enjoy.  Then mix the cards up gain, and since the play order would be different, a slightly different story resulted. I say slightly because if it was a murder mystery a replay wouldn't make it a story about horses.<p>I think that games are ready for the next evolution and that will continue the killing of movies and TV.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3492260&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3493132 href="vote?for=3493132&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3493132></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Natsu">Natsu</a> 13 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3493132">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>But you don't really have to stop watching TV or movies.

Why not apply the same kind of contracts movie studios make with directors and actors (base amount, and maybe some % of revenue), in reverse, so the artistic driving force between the project negotiates the same amount of deals with the financier.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; how do you get your series in front of people?<p>A simple answer would be 'social proof'. Mashable provides a TopTen list of the most watched shows. That's a good start but the site is too distracting for Average Joe, in my opinion.<p>Also, web series are too short for true passive entertainment. I guess what your communities would need is a sort of Google Adsense, so you could plug-in advertising to be able to produce longer streams.<p>That would at least provide you with some money. When one show hits it big, that'll make news, and more people would start looking for shows like that.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There's no reason you can't mix the two, though.  At my startup, we're building narrative driven games (like the old-school graphic adventures), reworked to feel more TV-like.  So we're really trying to be careful about the whole passive vs active issue.<p>Our take is - let the viewer be as passive as they want.  We're making a narrative-heavy experience, just like films and TV.  But we're adding an interactive twist so the viewer can change how the story unfolds.  And there's no reason we can't let the viewer just hit play and watch the story unfold as-is.  We encourage them to jump in, of course, but that's it - otherwise, the story goes along it's glide path till the end of the episode.  And when they're done, maybe they'd like to watch it again, but make a decision part way in to see how it effects the story.<p>A more mainstream example would be some on Nintendo's most recent work.  They've done a great job embracing the casual audience, and really pushed it in the most recent Super Mario Bros for the Wii - it actually included the ability for the game to play <i>itself</i> when players get stuck:<p><a href="http://wii.ign.com/articles/994/994640p1.html" rel="nofollow">http://wii.ign.com/articles/994/994640p1.html</a><p>Passive vs Active is tricky balancing act, and we're probably going to need to iterate on this a few times before we get it just right.  But we definitely think the balance can be struck in a way that'll resound with a casual audience more apt at consuming TV then video games.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3492822&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3493097 href="vote?for=3493097&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3493097></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=vidarh">vidarh</a> 13 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3493097">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Cinemaware in general produced awesome games, and some of the real classic in terms of bridging the gap between movies and games.<p>It's worth loading up an Amiga emulator (WinUAE or E-UAE) and getting hold of them - getting legal copies would be tricky, but copies abound...<p>I mentioned King of Chicago in particular because it was the most movie-like of the games - as I mentioned, if you just start it, it will run like a movie, complete with rolling movie like credits, but their other games have much of the same feel to them though you had to drive most of them forward by taking actions.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Well nothing is a full substitute for TV/movies, just like nothing is a substitute for novels. But the question is, is it an overall stronger form of entertainment? I'd say that video games definitely have the potential to be, the industry itself is already bigger than Hollywood and rapidly approaching the book industry [1]. And the market for games just keeps getting bigger that there is no point in trying to dissect why games are not a fit for certain people. It's still unexplored space as Minecraft, GTA, WoW, farmville and the Wii have shown. Make the right game and you can potentially gain a new audience.<p>And I'm not dodging your assertion either, because games can also be passive. I've spent god knows how many hours watching Starcraft II games - well more than I'd like to admit. That's a game that was built with spectators in mind. I probably enjoy watching the game more than playing it, as wonderful as it is. Apparently so do other people, TwitchTV is evidence enough.<p>1 - <a href="http://vgsales.wikia.com/wiki/Video_game_industry" rel="nofollow">http://vgsales.wikia.com/wiki/Video_game_industry</a></font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3492420&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3493078 href="vote?for=3493078&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3493078></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=sterling312">sterling312</a> 13 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3493078">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Although video game is not meant to be created as a passive entertainment, I think it is going that direction. With the combination of plot and amazing graphics, I don't see why a video game cannot be watched. Take for example Onlive, which allows you to stream game play of other total strangers. Or streamed Starcraft2 games. I know for a fact that a lot of my hard core gamer friends watch live stream from South Korea all the time.<p>From my personal experience, I used to actually play all the video games I thought was fun. However, ever since college ended, and when I have to use my time more wisely, playing a demanding video game counter intuitive as a stress relief. However, watching my roommate play video game is both entertaining and lacks the necessary attention I would need to attribute if I were playing the game. Of course, after watching my roommate play Skyrim twice might get a bit old. But then again, who watches the same TV show for over 30 hrs straight? I don't care how good mad men is, if I were to do two or three consecutive marathon of it, I would get tired of it too.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3493078&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3492824 href="vote?for=3492824&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3492824></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 13 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3492824">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>But that is the result of the cost of making games more "movie like" in the scale and complexity of the art and technology. As more and more of the technical complexity goes away and the cost of the art as well will drop, these big productions will start to face immense pressure from smaller teams.<p>You already see more and more games use licensed engines, and eventually the power of the platforms we deal with will intersect with rising quality of low cost or free engines at point where most people can start with an existing low cost engine and compete technically.<p>We started with a situation where off-the-shelf game engines was unthinkable, because game engines were optimized for a specific gameplay and intertwined with the game logic, but already there's a huge market for games made on licensed engines (and as far back as the 80's you had the first attempts at making "game maker" programs that used off the shelf engines and tools to cut the effort of making games)<p>Similarly on the art side you can expect to see more and more advanced tools that take away technical complexity of working on the art and return the focus to the art process itself and even simplify that.<p>E.g. consider a hypothetical tool where an artist creating a new character can pick from a catalogue of hundreds of pre-made skeletal structures, choose characteristics of the muscles and size, movement characteristics etc., pick from pre-made physical characteristics as a starting point for alterations, pick from catalogues of clothes, hair, eyes and so on - even other parts like the voice of the character, and have the software fill in the rest in terms of animation and other aspects.<p>Imagine a cottage industry of artists that design catalogue items for tools like this - you can already license tons of ready-made 3D models, after all, as well as specialized software for things like creating landscapes, plants, trees and a bunch of other 3D structures.<p>Of course none of this would remove the need for developers or artists, but it will free them to focus on game play and the actual art rather than how to work around technical limitations, and it becomes a massive leveller for smaller teams if you can start with an off the shelf engine, and populate your game with a bunch off catalogue item characters and then customize rather than having to start from scratch.<p>Incidentally a lot of these changes will eventually benefit independent movies as well in terms of making advanced CGI and postprocessing cheaper and more accessible.</font></span><p><font size=1><u><a href="reply?id=3493183&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b">reply</a></u></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3492151 href="vote?for=3492151&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%57%36%4a%67%72%54%34%55%43%6b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3492151></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=landhar">landhar</a> 13 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3492151">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I agree with this. I actually didn't go the route of school, preferring to just go out on my own, and I was/am amazed at all the passivity.<p>I think if anything the defining quality of my career is a total lack of being passive. Having no formal training allows you the quality of never being intimidated.<p>I didn't know anything when I started.
