<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Technological progress should cause increasing economic inequality, because the bottom end of the scale is firmly anchored at zero (someone taking a vacation), while technology gives the top end ever more powerful levers.<p>So the interesting question is not why economic inequality is increasing, but why for a few decades in the mid twentieth century the trend was reversed.<p>There are probably several factors at work here, but as someone who was around and paying attention at the end of that period, I think the key to the answer is the large corporation.  The period of flattening coincides with the heyday of the large corporation.<p>Large corporations tend to decrease economic inequality. You can't measure individual productivity well within large organizations, and even if you could, it would strain the fabric of the organization to reward people that way.  They also hide a lot of inequality by giving elite employees benefits that don't show up in their salaries (<a href="http://paulgraham.com/ladder.html" rel="nofollow">http://paulgraham.com/ladder.html</a>).<p>What happened at the end of the 1970s was that the most ambitious people started to lose interest in working their way up the corporate ladder.  They wanted to get paid upfront.  That was why the term "yuppie" was born then.  Before 1980 it was rare to find young professionals with lots of money.  In the old days, they were all still paying their dues at that age.<p>I remember the transition quite clearly.  When I was a little kid, in the early 70s, the most impressive thing you could do was to work for a large corporation.  It was the era of conglomerates in shiny office towers.  By 1980 we were starting to see a glimpse of the world we now live in, where the ambitious people are all free agents.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2979846 href="vote?for=2979846&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2979846></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=portman">portman</a> 147 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2979846">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000><i>I don't automatically assume it's a problem, as so many people seem to. I don't assume that all economic inequality is the medieval type, where the rich are the winners of a zero sum game.</i><p>The problem I see with growing income inequality is not the "inequality" part, it's the "growing" one.<p>From a purely mathematical point of view, in any economic climate there's some level of income inequality that's going to be economically optimal for whatever it is that we want to optimize about our economy (some combination of jobs, happiness, wealth, or whatever).  This is trivially true, as zero income inequality is a really crappy situation by most realistic measures of economic health, as is ultimate income inequality (i.e. a small handful of people holding all the wealth).  In between those extremes there's <i>got</i> to be some optimal distribution of wealth.<p>But when I see a march towards higher levels of inequality, I'm left to wonder whether there are actually any forces in play that will keep us anywhere near that optimum, or if we're just seeing a runaway "wealth begets wealth" situation, as folks like Mandelbrot have suggested.  Sure, it <i>could</i> be the case that the changing technological climate means that the optimal level of inequality is going up, and we're actually keeping pace with that, but that's just a "could be", and I've never seen a particularly compelling argument that our economy should work more efficiently now at higher levels of income inequality than, say, twenty years ago.  An argument that increasing income inequality is inevitable, or even that it's fair, is <i>not</i> an argument that it's economically helpful.<p>I completely agree with your thesis that technology is a perfectly valid reason for the growing gaps, FWIW, it's a pretty unassailable argument.  But I don't agree that it's not cause for concern: we're sliding at an increasing pace down the slippery slope, and at the bottom is complete human level AI, where a vanishing percentage of humans have anything at all of value to offer to the economy.  Are you <i>really</i> comfortable with the wealth distribution that's going to result from such a thing?<p>Personally (and this is quite controversial, I admit), I think that we have to start taking that inevitable outcome to heart, and realizing that the next 50 years should be a period where we move a lot closer to a full welfare state, with full acceptance of the fact that more and more of us will be at the unemployed and useless end of the spectrum as time goes on.  Then again, an economy where humans are less useful than their machines, even as far as designing and running those machines, is a completely different world than we've ever considered before, so perhaps it's premature to even consider what that means...</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2980915 href="vote?for=2980915&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2980915></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=firebones">firebones</a> 146 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2980915">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Robert Reich had a piece on NPR's Marketplace the other night [1] that seemed to contribute to this idea: the notion that while some were accepting 9% (rather than 6%) as the "new normal" in terms of unemployment rate, this was a calamitous development.  If you imagine a correlation between unemployment and economic inequality, then at one end of the spectrum, high unemployment and economic inequality leads to anarchy; as you slide down the scale, you pass through revolution, civil unrest, and malaise.<p>Let's assume that the optimum is farther down the spectrum (somewhere around "sustainability" but not so giddy as to be in "bubble" or "artificially-crafted giddy delusion").  Then what are the forces at play to drive us there?  From a political standpoint, it's electability; yet if we're too far into the inequality part of the spectrum, the fixes take more than an election cycle, and therefore require strong political leadership or near dictatorship (think FDR and no term limits as a model; think Japan and its many prime ministers over the last decade and stagnation as the counterexample).  That's not promising since it may mean only the Senate, with its six-year terms and only 1/3 of the membership up for re-election has a long enough time-frame to do what's needed.<p>But what about from a business perspective--what incentives and forces are there today in business to try to close that income gap?  Henry Ford allegedly paid well and understood that he needed to create a market for what he made, yet the auto industry today can't close that gap alone.  If Apple's prominence in the economy is comparable to Ford's, what hope is there that the jobs they create in China will create a positive feedback loop of income equality?  Perhaps with a global perspective it will.<p>Therefore, I come to the conclusion that the Ford Motor of the 21st century will be a company that is able to further its own market by empowering its customers (and the common, untrained person) to become value creators from an economic standpoint.  You see Google and Apple and even eBay nibbling around the edges, but who is going to emerge that harnesses and transmutes that latent economic power?<p>[1] <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/09/07/pm-the-new-normal-not-so-normal/" rel="nofollow">http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2011/09/07/pm...</a></font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2981018 href="vote?for=2981018&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2981018></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=WalterBright">WalterBright</a> 146 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2981018">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>On some level, income inequality is intrinsically problematic even if you don't care about social issues at all, or don't think it's a zero sum game.<p>Rich people have higher savings ratios than poor people. As a larger amount of income goes to those who have more than enough money than enough already, the average savings ratio increases. This is a drag on aggregate demand that hurts the economy.<p>Supply side economists will tell you that savings are not a problem because investment will go up. But then why would somebody invest when the people who would be interested in your product don't have the money to buy it because they're poor? This is pretty much the situation we're in right now, where there is no shortage of capital, but rather a shortage of possibilities for profitable investments because consumers have become more careful with their spending.<p>(I realize that it may look different from where you are standing - I am not an insider in the tech startup scene - but that is the picture in the larger economy.)<p>Another question that I am less certain about is how inequality affects economies of scale.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Thank you for the data.<p>As is so often the case, it comes down to how you interpret it and put it into relation to other things going on in the economy.<p>So real consumption is slightly above the previous peak. Now if productivity has increased in the three years that consumption had this "U" shape, it means the same amount of consumption goods and services can now be produced using less labour. This means that even though GDP may have returned to its previous peak level, this level of GDP is now accompanied by higher unemployment - unless new jobs have been created by something else.<p>A typical candidate for such job creation would be investment. However, given that consumption has only barely increased over the previous peak, there is currently little need for companies to make investments to satisfy consumption demand.<p>So I admit to not looking up the latest numbers before making my post, then I would have rephrased my statement. What's clear is that consumption hasn't returned to the previous trend (and probably won't), and that's a problem for the recovery (especially compared to the recovery from the 2000 recession, for example, where consumption did not deviate from the trend as the graph you linked to shows).</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2980970 href="vote?for=2980970&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2980970></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nandemo">nandemo</a> 146 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2980970">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Although my instincts are the same (i.e. inequality per se should not be a problem, logically), both introspection and some academic studies* suggest inequality actually is a problem. While the incremental benefits of more _absolute_ wealth seem to vanish in the limit, the psychological cost of _relative_ poverty seems to be constant. In his excellent book "Fault Lines", for example, Raghuram Rajan attributes a lot of the pressure on US politicians to funnel credit to ever wider segments of society to growing inequality in the US.<p>The problem is compounded by growing inequality of opportunity or decreasing social mobility (lower now than in many parts of supposedly "socialist" Europe, even!). Indeed, from my perspective -- as a European of East-Asian stock and traveling between the two regions -- the US looks more and more like a plutocracy, not unlike post-communist Russia, and not like a liberal democracy. The start-up system acts like a pressure valve in that system, but that just means there is pressure to begin with.<p>Which indicates another problem with high inequality: it seems to be self-reinforcing (ossification is the keyword here). You can see this on so many levels, starting with the fact that higher education in the US costs real money.<p>_____________________<p>* which I'm too lazy to locate and properly cite here and now</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2979962 href="vote?for=2979962&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2979962></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=forensic">forensic</a> 147 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2979962">link</a></span></div><br>

Quite the opposite. Society functions best when people are very aware that their choices have consequences and when they choose to act in ways that produce good consequences. In fact, individual responsibility is essential to civilization. Society would just fall apart if more than a few percent of people began acting irresponsibly.<p>For example, America has a problem with education. There are a lot of children not learning despite a lot of money being spent. I think a root cause of the problem is students knowing that nothing bad will happen to them if they don't work hard in school. If all the unmotivated students would be put to work for a few weeks in picking crops, with the promise that this will be their lot in life if they don't learn, I suspect the education problem would solve itself quickly.<p>We live in a world where it is possible to be tremendously productive and wealthy. But it is still necessary to labor and be disciplined to achieve wealth.<p>Retirement, doing nothing productive knowing that you will still be able to eat tomorrow, should be the reward of years of diligent work, not the entitlement of the lazy who want to benefit from the toil of others without contributing.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2981229 href="vote?for=2981229&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2981229></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Klinky">Klinky</a> 146 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2981229">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Inequality can be a bad thing without being an externality.  Externality has a precise economic meaning.  Pollution is a negative externality because the byproduct of my voluntary transaction to buy gas and burn it in my car is that you have to breathe the exhaust.  You are an external third party that is hurt without compensation. What external third party is being harmed when one person produces a lot and gets rich and another person doesn't?<p>One economic argument against inequality is that it results in people spending a lot of resources on guard labor.  If I live in neighborhood with lots of inequality I have to spend lots of resources keeping the poor people from stealing my things.  Therefore, reducing inequality via income distribution can create a public good in the form of less crime (and less resources wasted on protecting property). Thus, you can argue that redistributing income makes sense on the same grounds that having public police makes sense. That is an efficiency argument for reducing inequality.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2979934 href="vote?for=2979934&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2979934></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nicholasjbs">nicholasjbs</a> 147 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2979934">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Well put, as pg's essays usually are. But I think there are rather large gaps:<p>1) He glosses together reduction of income inequality with elimination of it. The zero inequality thing has been tried and failed.<p>2) one of his arguments is that better education of the poor will increase wealth inequality, because it will increase the number of customers and the number of possible entrepreneurs.<p>While the premises are no doubt true, the conclusion isn't. There are other inequality-decreasing factors that might well have a stronger impact. At the very least, a better educated population might have the wherewithal to organize and vote for increased taxes on wealthy people. Less cynically, better educated people need less stuff to get by (e.g. their cars last longer), and they are savvier consumers. And empirically, if one excludes the U.S., the best educated countries tend to also have the lowest income inequality.<p>3) pg neglects the <i>costs</i> of U.S. monetary policy on risk taking. The past 20 years have seen low inflation. When inflation is low, there is less need for money to be invested in order to preserve wealth.  With higher rates of inflation, investors have no choice but to try and extract greater value out of the wealth they have if they want to keep up.<p>4) A related point: pg's argument is that high taxes reduce the large rewards founders get, causing them to take smaller risks. Yet there is nothing intrinsic about taxation that necessitates the burden fall primarily on the recently wealthy. PG's argument doesn't easily apply to "old money" -- would the decrease in upside of a wealth tax outweigh the incentives to invest imposed by a wealth tax?<p>From a tech progress/startup perspective, wouldn't the elimination of capital gains in favor of a tax on wealth cause exactly the <i>right</i> kinds of incentives for starting companies?</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2980885 href="vote?for=2980885&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2980885></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Roboprog">Roboprog</a> 146 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2980885">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Who said anything about impoverishing anyone? What does "impoverish" mean, exactly, to you?<p>In France, the wealth tax is 0% under €800k, increasing to a maximum of 1.8% (once the person gets to ~€17 million). How could this lead to impoverishment when even relatively conservative asset management averages returns of &#62;5%? Even in this case the party's wealth is still increasing (especially since the proposal is to offset the wealth tax by eliminating all capital gains taxes, which are already extremely difficult to calculate).<p>And it's hardly an abuse: property taxes (a kind of wealth tax) are already levied, and while many complain, few claim it is government overreach. Government policy that favors a small and already powerful minority would seem to be a much greater abuse.<p>The bigger question is: why do most governments tax people for creating value, instead of taxing people for failing to?</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2980300 href="vote?for=2980300&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2980300></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=vacri">vacri</a> 146 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2980300">link</a></span></div><br>

I do think there are some downsides, like the threat of violent revolution, but my point is that I'm not making some hobgoblin of wealth or income inequality.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>There is an interesting book, "The Spirit Level: Why Equality is Better for Everyone" by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett, that makes a very strong argument that in developed countries inequality is correlated pretty much every "bad" metric (health, crime, teenage pregnancy, etc.) of a society.<p>Now, of course, correlation does not mean causation and it's perhaps more interesting what the true underlying causes are.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I wish I could upvote this more.  It constantly astounds me that people construct elaborate theories about the decay of morality amongst the elite of America when faced with such a powerful supply/demand argument.  It's pretty simple really: the industrialized nations spent tremendous resources over a span of about 7 reducing each other to rubble.  At the end of it, they wanted to rebuild, and the only country with industrial capacity remaining was the United States.  Furthermore, the process of rebuilding was extremely labor-intensive, involving construction and manufacture of durable commercial and consumer goods in an environment with low automation.  To top it all off, when the other nations were finally rebuilt and started to be competitive again, the size of the available labor pool simultaneously started to expand as women entered the workforce.  The middle-class American dream was the result of a global labor market anomaly that lasted for several decades, which was long enough to convince everyone that it was the new normal, and the long decline since the late 70s was the result of that anomaly ending.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2980621 href="vote?for=2980621&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2980621></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=OstiaAntica">OstiaAntica</a> 146 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2980621">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Back in the 1950s, the rich were really good at tax avoidance.  All they had to do was to donate more than their total income to charity.  (The so-called flying nun tax exemption.)  This was doable because when you donated items that appreciated in value, you didn't get taxed on the increase in value, but got to claim the whole value.<p>So if your parents had bought a lot of art, you could donate the art.  Better yet you could donate a million dollars to a charitable foundation you had, have them use it to buy a piece of art from you, and then donate 4 other pieces of art which are now valued at $1 million each.<p>The result was a huge run-up in the value of things like art, and a simultaneous increase in public art for display.  When you visit the Metropolitan Museum, you're basically seeing the benefits of a tax dodge.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2979975 href="vote?for=2979975&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2979975></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=kongqiu">kongqiu</a> 147 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2979975">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>As a US citizen you may not be aware of this, but the time between 1970 and 1980 was also when full employment was effectively abandoned as a policy goal in most Western countries.<p>In countries like France, Germany and Australia, unemployment was constantly below 4% for many decades after WWII, even below 1% in many cases. What's more, rises in the unemployment rate due to recessions were quickly and successfully fought using fiscal policy. In fact, such policies where quite consciously implemented after WWII even in countries that did not see large scale destruction, because the consensus was that returning soldiers needed to be given employment to avoid social problems.<p>Unfortunately, low unemployment meant better bargaining positions for workers, and so getting rid of this "problem" was quite openly discussed for some time (this was documented in a PhD thesis, <a href="http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=11941" rel="nofollow">http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=11941</a>). Economic troubles in the 1970s helped convince people that something needed to change and made it easier for attitudes towards economic policy to be changed, i.e. the shock doctrine. Thatcher in the UK was probably the most memorable driver of this change with her very open fight against unions.<p>It seems to me that a nice test of which of the two explanations fits the bill better is to compare the development to countries in which those measures of inequality, unemployment, and decoupling of real wage from productivity increases did not change at the same time as in the US.<p>Was it because the large corporation developed differently, or was it because those political shifts happened at a different time?</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2980364 href="vote?for=2980364&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2980364></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=notahacker">notahacker</a> 146 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2980364">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm inclined to agree.  It's striking how the graph showing the wealth flow to the top 1% correlates with changes to the capital gains tax rate.  There are benefits to a low cap gains rate, but below a certain level, it seems associated with slower growth, more of the income flowing to the top, and more volatility and crashes.<p>You can make the argument it's goosing the economy to concentrate more and more capital into a single point of failure, a deeply interconnected network of financial firms.  And you gotta wonder what the economy would look like, if Wall Street hadn't been siphoning off so much of the brains and capital to play card tricks.  It might otherwise have gone towards, say, innovations in healthcare, transportation, energy, even domestic manufacturing.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2988935 href="vote?for=2988935&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2988935></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rmc">rmc</a> 144 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2988935">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Just conjecture:  senior management in established corporations have stacked the payscales in their favor.  I know senior managers in established corporations who have received ridiculously large bonuses and stock option grants for doing nothing other than what should ordinarily be expected of them for the benefit of the corporation, and their level of risk is so small relative to their reward.  In some cases, the benefit to the corporation is of questionable value, yet excessively lavish compensation is granted.  I suspect that some of these senior managers are greedier and more short-term oriented (I'll milk this baby as much as I can for my personal gain here and now) than their pre-yuppie predecessors.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think because, there's no reason to assume they would be - labor costs are still (mostly) driven by supply and demand.  If gizmos and computers and internets increase a worker's productivity, the gains go to the business owners, while the worker still gets paid at whatever the labor market decides.  (During the 60's era wage earners had some natural advantages: booming demand for labor, restricted supply since single-income households were the norm, less ability to send manufacturing or service jobs offshore.)<p>Higher top rates in the 60's era also meant some of that productivity gain in wealth went back to the average worker.  The whole economy gained wealth from public investment in infrastructure, funding for education, healthcare research and so on.  But around the late 70's, the tide started to turn towards lower taxes at the top.  A few more trends got rolling at the same time: technology that made big productivity gains possible; entire manufacturing industries being sent overseas; the financial industry getting really interested in ways to move existing wealth from where it was, to their own pockets.<p>That makes it sound entirely bad, which it wasn't... those trends also led to a slew of innovative new companies, disruptions to established business practices, stock options as a way to share in the risk and reward, and lots of cool gadgets.  It's more interesting now than in 1960.  But there are a lot of workers getting the shaft, and don't necessarily need to be.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2980083 href="vote?for=2980083&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2980083></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=forensic">forensic</a> 147 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2980083">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>With all due respect, your graph ends in 2007, right before it hit the fan.  The income of the bottom 20% is virtually flat from 1980 to 2007 in that graph, with a slight, temporary, swell in the late 1990s.  Add in the last 2 or 3 years on the tail of the graph, and that seems quite consistent with the article showing the bottom quintile (20%) losing a few percent of income between 1980 and then.<p>The other quintiles, even the 21-40% group, have made real gains, and that's good, and most of your arguments apply to the other 4/5.  However, it looks like we are slowly creating an underclass.<p>Do these people really have clean drinking water?  Safe streets, homes and schools?  Clean, healthy, food?  A decent public education?  I'm not talking about cheap toys, I mean basics of life.<p>Final rant:  this stuff is personal for me.  My family and I are a single income family, near the top of the 4th quintile <i>now</i> (&#60; $120 K may not sound like much in Sunnyvale, but it goes a little ways in Sacramento), but I spent most of my childhood fairly poor.  I was about 16 when Reagan's reign of error started ("Reagan" being a figurehead to represent the era and all its players).  I went to college in the mid 80s, and watched the door to inexpensive public education largely being pulled shut bit by bit during the 80s.  My academic abilities were in about the top 2 to 5 percent, but how is a poor, but smart, kid supposed to go to college now without piling on many thousands of debt?  Are we doomed to live in a world run by legacy dullards like W???</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2981232 href="vote?for=2981232&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2981232></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=egiva">egiva</a> 146 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2981232">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I had similar experiences in the Sacramento area, but almost exactly one decade after you (probably ten years younger) - the idea that stings me the most is the "door to inexpensive public education" being slammed shut - I've got to say that the door being slammed has greatly accelerated these past 6 years, as tuition has jumped. In the 70s, education at a UC school was nearly free. Today it costs $30k/year including your fees, books and living expenses.<p>In light of flat income growth, that means families either work more or do without. The scary thing (for me) is that we're reaching the maximum of the "work more" strategy when both parents work 1+ jobs. Where do people go from here, considering that they've reached the maximum of their family's earning potential while prices are still rising? I suspect that we're seeing the beginning of the real decline these past few years - with not only stagnant real income growth, but a decline in the amount of things we can afford, and that means less college education, a less educated work force, and rapidly accelerating (if it wasn't already) income inequality.<p>When you're priced out of a good education (can't afford one) that's when we cease to be a merit-based society where able people work their way up.  That's the end of the American Dream in not so many words.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2981043 href="vote?for=2981043&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2981043></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=buff-a">buff-a</a> 146 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2981043">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"Technological progress should cause increasing economic inequality" is a bold statement.  Presumably, increasing productivity <i>for everyone</i> is one of the signal benefits of technological progress.  If we accept that as true, then why can we not say that technological progress is agnostic as far as economic inequality is concerned?<p>Many of the arguments about economic inequality in this thread seem to be predicated on the notion that we are talking about comparing salaries or car brands.  Don't be jealous of your neighbor for having a higher salary or a better car, and why should he have to give up more of his money via taxes just to enhance your lifestyle... seems to be the gist.<p>But income inequality is rooted in the question not of does your neighbor have more goodies, but how do we divide the spoils of our shared enterprise.  If you and your neighbor are partners in the same firm, and you are working your ass off so that he can ride around in a Benz, things are a little different.<p>It is interesting to observe that when this argument is couched in terms immediately relevant to most of the posters here, the response on HN is quite different.  I.e. "I have a great business idea, I just need someone to code it for 1% of the business equity".  There are markedly fewer posters defending this notion, or condemning the hacker who wants a bigger share as exhibiting some kind of perverse socialist urge toward income redistribution, than there are posters in this thread defending the same notion expanded to society as a whole.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_2980217 href="vote?for=2980217&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%75%53%63%4f%31%65%68%56%50%4b"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_2980217></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=Hyena">Hyena</a> 147 days ago  | <a href="item?id=2980217">link</a></span></div><br>

Well, there are persons that can make millions not working in a company (ie. Indie game developer, iphone app developer...). But when you work for a large corporation, you might take 20% more than the average developer, but not 20X times more.<p>So large corporations increase equality among developers. Boss get paid 10 times more than a dev. gets? Well, a boss is not a developer, and you are doing the wrong comparison here. Compare the boss in this corporation to another boss in another large corporation. They are getting paid in the same range, no? That's equality.<p>When you are your own boss, and your friends is his own boss; you can become as unequal as you want.
