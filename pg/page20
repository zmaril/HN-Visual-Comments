<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I am not sure if VC firms doing seed investing have done it in such large numbers and if not (which I think is the case), are they setup to manage 100 startups a year versus 15.<p>Also I am wondering if this approach will have to be the new approach or the one that Khosla, Benchmark, Sequoia (I understand they are indirectly in YC companies) and similar ones have had for long, of identifying big trends, finding the right company and going big behind it, is still better. I have seen the latter fail as well as succeed. I think we have very little data on the former but there is bound to be a limited set of companies that a VC partnership can optimally support / manage and this new approach may put a strain on it. I guess we have to wait and see.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>As a SV outsider who recently spent a month there, I totally agree. The only way to get meetings is through your network. Start with people you meet at events and then add to it (co working spaces like www.rocket-space.com are great for this). Eventually you'll be speaking to company founders and they can refer you. Remember that the quality of the referral is also important, so if you have only met someone for 5 mins and then ask them to refer you, their referral email will be rather weak. Spend the time building the relationship and getting them excited about your product. Then when the time comes you will get a solid referral and a near certain meeting.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3113770 href="vote?for=3113770&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%70%4e%56%51%32%49%4b%46%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3113770></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=dan_manges">dan_manges</a> 111 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3113770">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>If a handful of YC companies are truly asking for a $9M or 14M pre...  as rumors are flying around in Silicon Valley state...  Then, I could see why VC's might say that the market is overpriced and frothy.  Especially, since 6 months earlier, those same startups were priced by YC at a $300k pre.<p>No doubt YC has a phenomenal brand, and does a great job, and has had a couple of impressive rounds raised recently by AirBnb and DropBox.<p>But, there's a huge segment of the startup ecosystem that doesn't really show up on HN.<p>MassChallenge is graduating 125 startups next month.  Their last batch, last summer has raised $100M in total.<p>Angel List has helped over 700 startups get funded in the past 18 months.<p>Startup Chile just seed funded 125, and opened applications open for another 100 startups today.<p>Then, there's 500 Startups, IO Ventures, RockHealth, AngelPad, StartX, BlockBox, TechStars, etc...  And, a number of those startups have raised really impressive rounds, but they don't tend to get the local blog coverage or coverage here on HN.<p>Who knows...

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm not alarmed because there seems to be two very distinct crowds of people who hang out on hacker news.  "Startup people", like yourself, who are across the political spectrum, with probably a disproportionate number of libertarians (as compared to the broader population) and the /r/politics crowd which are very anti-capitalist, anti-innovation, pro-taxes, etc.<p>Some threads attract one crowd and the comments go one way, other threads attract the other crowd and the comments go the other way.<p>I really wish Hacker News was about startups, and if there was any debate, we were all capitalists debating it.  I'm tired of the seemingly endless stream of leftist propaganda that gets promoted to the front page (e.g.: anything by Krugman, for example.)  I'd hate this just as much if it were all rightest propaganda.  IF it was balanced, I wouldn't like it, but it wouldn't be irritating.<p>When almost all the discussions are of one mindset, and posting something outside that mindset gets you down voted to oblivion, I feel like intellectual discussion is much more difficult.  This isn't always the case here, obviously, but sometimes it is.<p>I don't really care for Amazon, but at least when Amazon is on the front page its because they did something relevant to the site.  I can just ignore those threads. Amazon' announcing that they've got a new finger service in AWS doesn't add anything for me, but it doesn't detract like the political topics do.<p>Cloudant, a company that takes CouchDB and turns it into a dynamo style ring, has produced something significant in their platform.   We should be talking about this.<p>Cloudant provides a very useful tool that should be very highly relevant to people who are doing startups.<p>The thing is, I suspect a major population of HN commenters aren't really doing startups or planning to.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105036 href="vote?for=3105036&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%70%4e%56%51%32%49%4b%46%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105036></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 114 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105036">link</a></span></div><br>

Even if the logic wasn't childish ("fuck X by association", really?), the comment does little to substantiate its opinions, or to educate those who aren't aware of the issue. In other words, it's a populist comment expressly made to pander to those who are already in agreement.<p>Upvoting said comment means either (a) you haven't even considered the importance of having a quality discussion, (b) you've considered it but in this case you don't care, or (c) you actually think it's a high quality comment. The fact that the comment is sitting pretty at the top of the page means that people have, en masse, fallen into one of these categories.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Mr. Graham, wow, this is rather disappointing to hear. You wish to frame a discussion through ad hominem instead of on the merits. For what it's worth I am apolitical, and have little interest in provoking controversy, but that doesn't mean I wish to see the promotion of a company which pushes injustice across the world.<p>Previously, I had looked up to you as a bit of a hero, now my opinion of you has dived quite low. I would not have minded if you disagreed with the merits of what Monsanto and Monsanto's customers choose to do. However, referring to people as dumb, for upvoting what is essentially a very well held and defensible position is a very weak thing to do. There are lots of arguments to be made against Monsanto, not the least of which is its Superfund environmental disaster sites.<p>The point is, I am informed, I know exactly what I am against, and have every reason to be outraged at the injustice perpetrated by Monsanto. This is furthered by needing to make the same arguments against Monsanto at my own company. If we've gotten to the point where we can't be outraged against injustice, then we may as well be heartless automatons.<p>To summarily dismiss them in this way and at the same time attack the intelligence of your readers is, well, reprehensible. Call me dumb if you will, I won't make arguments to the level of my own intelligence, but know that you have invalidated every reason to see you as a role model.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105683 href="vote?for=3105683&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%70%4e%56%51%32%49%4b%46%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105683></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nirvana">nirvana</a> 113 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105683">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#737373>If you were apolitical, you wouldn't see monsanto as "a company which pushes injustice across the world".<p>Notice that this thread is full of such disparaging assertions, but no actual details, no citations, and the closest anyone gets is to pointing to people who have a very clear political agenda who make accusations against monsanto.<p>"what is essentially a very well held and defensible position"<p>I think this is what he's referring to as "dumb".  This is not a "defensible" position because it isn't a fact, it is merely a dislike.  As for "very well held" its unclear what you mean, except maybe you mean "widely held".  I think it is dumb to assume that just because a lot of people say the same thing about something, that means they are right, especially when they cannot go into details, and what they are saying is just broad political assertions.<p>"The point is, I am informed, I know exactly what I am against, and have every reason to be outraged at the injustice perpetrated by Monsanto."<p>If you're informed, why aren't you specific?  Even when describing what you're outraged, the best you can say is "injustice".  Such a weak word, and what does it really mean anyway?  They did something you don't like?<p>Wendy's screwed up my order the other day, giving me someone else's food, and they didn't give me a coupon to compensate.  Oh, the injustice!  Sure, that's silly, but at least I described specifically what they did wrong!<p>You're "outraged" at something you can't even describe.  Yet you're "apolitical".  Really?<p>Personally, I'm so tired of people going around repeating things they heard from other people, without doing any investigation or applying a legitimate moral compass to the issue.<p>This leads to "heartless automatons"... people who are easily controlled by media outlets.  "Hate walmart!"  (but don't hate Target, they're just the same, only they're unionized, and therefore they're not evil.)  "Blame Wall Street!" (But ignore the government that, via regulation, forced banks to make loans to people who couldn't repaying them, claiming that to do otherwise was "racist".) etc. etc. etc.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3106488 href="vote?for=3106488&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%70%4e%56%51%32%49%4b%46%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3106488></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=nowarninglabel">nowarninglabel</a> 113 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3106488">link</a></span></div><br>

"Monsanto entered India in 2002 with some very compelling advertising. They claimed their engineered seeds would produce yields up to five times that of conventional cotton – 20 quintals per acre (equivalent to approximately 4.5 bales) compared to the 4 quintals (less than 1 bale) farmers were struggling to pull from their fields at the time. At the time, Monsanto admitted that their seeds costed more but insisted that investment would pay dividends.<p>Unfortunately the average yield of Monsanto’s GE cotton turned out to be nowhere near the advertised 20 quintals per acre. In reality the average output of the crop turned out to be 1.2 quintals per acre. Nowhere in India did it exceed 4 quintals per acre at the end of the harvest. To add insult to injury, farmers soon found out that the fibers produced by the Monsanto GE cotton plants were of lower quality. Instead of getting the usual $86 per quintal, they were only able to sell their crops for around $36 per quintal.
On average since 2002, of the farmers in India, many of whom fell into the Monsanto trap, one is committing suicide every 30 minutes. Many end their lives by drinking RoundUp."<p>The list goes on, if you've read this far and want more, I'll be glad to dig up some more of the material.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105245 href="vote?for=3105245&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%70%4e%56%51%32%49%4b%46%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105245></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=oldstrangers">oldstrangers</a> 113 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105245">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm not sure how many more ways I can break this down for you. I figured my previous comment was pretty clear.<p>Asserting that Cloudant is only selling Monsanto a simple data analysis is disingenuous, as clearly proven by Cloudant's own press release where they state how significant their partnership with Monsanto is. Partnership is a key word here.<p>Selling someone a service like Google Analytics (random example) is a lot different than partnering with a company for multiple weeks and shaping the entire core functionality of a company around your collaborative efforts. Even more so is saying that this partnership will help shape the way the company fundamentally does business.<p>Like I said, its disingenuous to downplay Cloudant's role, considering how highly they emphasized said role.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105308 href="vote?for=3105308&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%70%4e%56%51%32%49%4b%46%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105308></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=janj">janj</a> 113 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105308">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>When I attended the Startup School in 2007, I had to apply.  I was sure I wasn't going to get in, but I did, and when I got there I understood that the application wasn't elitist, it was because the venue was pretty fixed in size... and the quality of the event was much different due to this (relatively light) filter you'd applied.<p>I think hacker news would be much different if you applied a similar filter.<p>If everyone here were someone sincerely interested in doing a startup, who believed that it was moral to make money by improving people's lives, and believed that technological innovation was a good way to do it, then I think the site would be much different.<p>The early quality has turned HN into a popular source for a certain segment of news.  But that has diluted it as an effective community.<p>Occasionally there's been talk of doing another site along these lines, but the right kind of filter wasn't obvious.<p>I think that it is clear what the right kind of filter is-- an application form like the Startup School one.<p>I don't know what your intentions are for HN going forward, if you have any interest in making significant changes or not.   After Nirvana (my open source web platform project) is released, and my startups MVP is done, I intend to write software for a community of startup founders and see if we can make a go of it.<p>But you have a much bigger following.  I think if you liked this idea, picking a hundred or so of the commenters you liked the best from the site would enable rapid evaluation of such applications (especially if the applications were relatively short).   However, it might be too easy to game such a system.<p>But that's where my thoughts are.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Can't speak for PG, but I'd say you lost him by #2. I never understood this kind of lump-everything-together thinking. It's overly idealistic, totally illogical, and almost always hypocritical.<p>Yes, boycotting a business is a common way to demonstrate your disapproval with some of their practices. However, it doesn't follow that doing business with a company implies condoning of all of their actions. I'm sorry, but there's no logic that supports such a conclusion.<p>And even if the logic existed, anyone who invoked it would be a glaring hypocrite. I assume you use a bank? Pay taxes to your government? Buy food, and shelter, and other products? Well you're undoubtedly a patron to at least a few entities who've committed atrocities. By your own logic, you condone each and every one of these attrocities.

People on HN are thinkers.  Sure there are clusters of opinion, but these aren't disjoint sets across the spectrum.  We have a variety of nuanced opinion because we all think a lot.<p>Case in point: me.  I guess you could say I lean a bit liberal, but fiscally I'm conservative because I think on balance the government doesn't do a good job spending money.  I believe in capitalism, but I also believe that regulation is necessary (despite its blunt nature) to protect the public good.<p>The Monsanto issue an important one.  They are profiting at the expense of the quality of the world food supply, and they use a lot of strong-arm methods to maintain their profits.  Reasonable people can disagree about various corporations' practices, but to pigeon-hole people who complain about Monsanto rather than going and educating yourself about what they do does yourself and the whole world a disservice.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"The reason this comment thread is a worrying sign for HN is that you didn't use to have to think like a PR person here."<p>A couple of things.<p>Why are we talking about the "PR issue"? I offered Cloudant an alternative reality where, if they insisted on being evil, that their evil doings be kept in the closet. It makes wise business sense if you're going to accept money from anyone under the sun. That has nothing to do with thinking like a PR person, nor does it have anything to do with having this article spun or censored. You seem to think this deal is ok, so I tried to provide a solution that suited your own interests.<p>However, it is perhaps ironic that by spinning your own comments to focus on these PR irrelevancies, you have successfully avoided providing any significant contribution. Worse yet, was the "PR spin" of yours by comparing Cloudant's strategic and "fundamentally business shaping" partnership with Monsanto to someone selling a car or a computer... I guess though that's not PR talk, that's politician talk. Expert level diversion.<p>Monsanto is a disgusting, despicable, horrible company of the worst variety. Should we give Cloudant a pass for dealing with these people because you have a vested interest? I will happily leave HN forever if you think that is the case.<p>Google started their company with the motto "Do No Evil." Ethics have a substantial place in business practice, so I don't see why they shouldn't have a place on HN.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105340 href="vote?for=3105340&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%70%4e%56%51%32%49%4b%46%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105340></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=ForrestN">ForrestN</a> 113 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105340">link</a></span></div><br>

People want to believe that you all aren't just smart, that you're good guys, so to speak, ie. that all the talk about "being good" isn't opportunistic, or that you aren't mean and reactive.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>1. If we continue our use of herbicides/pesticides to the point of wide-spread colony collapse, spread of plant disease (perhaps canola, soy, or corn), significant reduction of nitrate fixation, increased human cancers we may also see hundreds of millions of people die or be without food.<p>Obviously, no one is suggesting we stop producing enough food for people to eat. But you need to look past the next 5, 10, 25 years. Those issues listed above are all real. And can all be linked to herbicides/pesticides and monocultures. We need to work on a new solution, a new system. The current situation is not a long-term answer.<p>2. This is more a theoretical morality issue. How much control/ownership should any one entity be allowed to have on life. What if they aren't just patenting seeds for RoundUp resistance? More so, say I live in a certain climate where I want a certain field tomato to grow. And under those circumstances I end up with a seed similar to a patented Monsanto seed. I lose in court. Other varieties of tomatoes don't grow will in my area. What do I do? I no longer have the freedom or right to grow successful tomatoes. This is not reality, but a possibility. One, that I do not believe in the slightest is worth risking. This could also lead to outrageous seed pricing.<p>Oh while I'm at it. Let's add climate change, land degradation (<a href="http://news.mongabay.com/2006/1214-unu.html" rel="nofollow">http://news.mongabay.com/2006/1214-unu.html</a>).

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>1. There is plenty of genetic diversity (aka hetrozygosity). The most credible evidence suggests that Colony Collapse Syndrome was caused by a disease, not GMO seed. Also, all of the seed companies take tremendous care to ensure that their patented biotech traits (BT) keep working in future, which is why they all have refuge requirements (meaning a farmer must plant at least X percent of their crop that isn't BT, which makes sure that various pests continue to breed with genes that will make their offspring susceptible to herbicide/pesticide treatment).<p>2. Corn has tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of genes and has roughly 22 million nucleotide base pairs. Having two breeders from two different companies come up with roughly the same plant interdependently is in the astronomical range.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3104368 href="vote?for=3104368&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%70%4e%56%51%32%49%4b%46%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3104368></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=biznickman">biznickman</a> 114 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3104368">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Here is a potential reason why some are upset. Its obvious that large corporations like Chevy, Clorox, Apple sell to Monstanto [and other corporations some could consider "bad" or whatever you want to label it]. But when startups do it [especially YC startups who I generally believe have smarter people involved relative to large corporations] it is felt because people generally hold them to higher standards [not just in situations like this, it applies for operational, financial and strategic measures as well]. I worked at a YC startup for a while, and saw some pretty generous things done by YC founders for society.<p>Another way to look at it (if it helps you understand the other perspective): You frequently see YC funded companies help each other out. Why do they do it? Is it just to accumulate more wealth/raise a valuation? Or is it because they've developed meaningful relationships and care for each other? I use this example to show how empathy and relationships can impact business decisions in a general sense, and that this same logic could be used to apply to a YC company NOT being proud of serving a large corporation known to use tactics that harm farmers in underdeveloped nations.<p>The fact that you use the term 'hold to a standard' at least implies that some could perceive the action as 'slimy'.<p>Finally, as someone wise once said, "be the change you want to see in the world" -- of course we hold YC companies to a higher standard :), many are made up of brilliant and compassionate individuals whose products make the world a better place. /cheese</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3106768 href="vote?for=3106768&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%70%4e%56%51%32%49%4b%46%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3106768></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=csallen">csallen</a> 113 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3106768">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>&#62; It's an unfortunate sign for HN when the top comment on a thread is such a <i>content-free</i> rant.<p>To the contrary, the tenor of the majority of comments makes it clear that the context is <i>well</i>-understood already, and this is encouraging.<p>Users evidencing a strong moral compass is a reason to rejoice, not despair.<p>If you want some context, try Wikipedia.<p><i>Monsanto is responsible for more than 50 United States Environmental Protection Agency Superfund sites, attempts to clean up Monsanto Chemical's formerly uncontrolled hazardous waste sites.[27]</i><p><i>The Center for Food Safety[108] listed 112 lawsuits by Monsanto against farmers for claims of seed patent violations.[27] The Center for Food Safety's analyst stated that many innocent farmers settle with Monsanto because they cannot afford a time consuming lawsuit. Monsanto is frequently described by farmers as "Gestapo" and "Mafia" both because of these lawsuits and because of the questionable means they use to collect evidence of patent infringement.[27]</i><p>It's a combination of a major environmental polluter and a patent troll.<p><i>Dumping of toxic waste in the UK<p>Between 1965 and 1972, Monsanto paid contractors to illegally dump thousands of tons of highly toxic waste in UK landfill sites, knowing that their chemicals were liable to contaminate wildlife and people. The Environment Agency said the chemicals were found to be polluting groundwater and the atmosphere 30 years after they were dumped.[71]<p>The Brofiscin quarry, near Cardiff, erupted in 2003, spilling fumes over the surrounding area, but the local community was unaware that the quarry housed toxic waste.<p>A UK government report shows that 67 chemicals, including Agent Orange derivatives, dioxins and PCBs exclusively made by Monsanto, are leaking from one unlined porous quarry that was not authorized to take chemical wastes. It emerged that the groundwater has been polluted since the 1970s.[72] The government was criticised for failing to publish information about the scale and exact nature of this contamination. According to the Environment Agency it could cost £100m to clean up the site in south Wales, called "one of the most contaminated" in the UK.[73]</i><p>One thing to remember is that patents are fundamentally at odds with food availability.  You can either have Big Pharma-like profits, or cheap food that feeds billions.<p>As it is, countries with functional governments already overproduce food.  Zimbabwe used to be called the "Breadbasket of Africa" before Mugabe.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3105929 href="vote?for=3105929&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%70%4e%56%51%32%49%4b%46%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3105929></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=rjstatic">rjstatic</a> 113 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3105929">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>It's not so much that it's ahead of its time relative to hardware as it is something you do in the early versions of a program.<p>Using closures to store state on the server is a rapid prototyping technique, like using lists as data structures.  It's elegant but inefficient. In the initial version of HN I used closures for practically all links.  As traffic has increased over the years, I've gradually replaced them with hard-coded urls.<p>Lately traffic has grown rapidly (it usually does in the fall) and I've been working on other things (mostly banning crawlers that don't respect robots.txt), so the rate of expired links has become more conspicuous. I'll add a few more hard-coded urls and that will get it down again.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3099422 href="vote?for=3099422&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%46%70%4e%56%51%32%49%4b%46%55"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3099422></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=biot">biot</a> 115 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3099422">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm not referring to any specific amount of traffic.  I'm referring to how users expect a website to work.  If the user sees a link, especially a More or Login link then the user expects it to do just what it says.  When those don't work I would call that a bug.  I'm in agreement that this technique can be useful for rapid prototyping, but I also think this site is probably the most active and mass used prototype I've ever seen. ;)<p>My goal for a web site or web app is to have 0 expired links.  Sometimes stuff you link to outside your site will go dead, and it must be fixed or removed or whatnot.  But for your own internal stuff... I don't know... something doesn't feel right about an architecture that allows that systematically.  How much time could you save if you didn't even have to worry about fixing any expired links?  Any idea on what the ROI on your time would be?<p>Anyway, just thinking out loud.  Thanks again for the site though.
