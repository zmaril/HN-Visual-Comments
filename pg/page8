Ouch.<p>Worse, I think it's totally wrong.<p>While I do agree with the problem of "power corrupts", I believe that Spamhaus have been highly successful at avoiding that.<p>I've dealt with and spoken with people at Spamhaus regularly, and they're smart people fighting the good fight. They know what they're doing, and take their responsibilities seriously. They don't blindly attack people or use threats or accuse them of misdeads. They gather evidence about bad behaviour and act on it.<p>The proof is in the pudding. 100's of RBLs have come and gone over the years, either run as temporary projects that the owner gave up on one day, or gone the "power corrupts" option and just ended up listing so many IPs they've generated too many false positives (e.g. SPEWS).<p>Spamhaus RBLs are still being run today, and being done so very successfully. Virtually every small/medium email server I know uses them in one form or another (blocking or scoring). They generally have very high block rates, and very low false positive rates.<p>From a time when Al Iverson was still keeping stats on the various RBLs out there, you can see the Spamhaus zen RBL on it's own generally caught 75% of spam with 0% false positives.<p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080703181952/http://stats.dnsbl.com/zen.html" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20080703181952/http://stats.dnsbl...</a><p>Certainly some listings are controversial (eg google docs), but it's always been for a good reason, and forced the provider of the service to come to terms with the fact their spam policies were lax or their service was being seriously abused by spammers. They were thus forced to take action, something they should have been doing anyway.<p>Without Spamhaus, the internet would be a way worse place, with way more spam/junk emails and websites.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3410301 href="vote?for=3410301&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%4c%72%32%61%65%43%68%42%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3410301></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3410301">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>So you're still saying that maybe they didn't start that way, but right now they are bad people, who have lost their way morally.<p>I think that's an incredibly harsh accusation for people that are doing an awful lot of work collecting evidence and fighting real spammers on the internet (<a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/rokso/index.lasso" rel="nofollow">http://www.spamhaus.org/rokso/index.lasso</a>), and again, I totally disagree with you.<p>&#62; though you have to admit that running a blacklist might tend to attract a certain type of person<p>I think you could tar so many people in so many industries with broad brush stroke sterotypes like that, it seems an unhelpful generalisation to make.<p>From the article you link:<p>&#62; As of this writing, any filter relying on the SBL is now marking email with the url "paulgraham.com" as spam.<p>The SBL is an IP based RBL, nothing to do with domains, so the above statement is patently false. And if anyone was doing IP lookups of URI's in emails and using the SBL for that (which I've never even heard of), that's clearly a misuse of the SBL anyway, because that's not what the SBL is supposed to be used for.<p>As the policy clearly says:<p>---
<a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/policy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.spamhaus.org/sbl/policy.html</a><p>The Spamhaus Block List ("SBL") Advisory is a database of IP addresses which do not meet Spamhaus's policy for acceptance of inbound email and therefore from which Spamhaus does not recommend the acceptance of electronic mail. 
---<p>So it should only be used to block machines sending email, nothing about the content thereof.<p>There's RHSBLs (like SURBL and URIBL) that are related to dealing with URI's in emails, that's nothing to do with IP RBLs like SBL.<p>&#62; Why? Because the guys at the SBL want to pressure Yahoo, where paulgraham.com is hosted, to delete the site of a company they believe is spamming<p>What's that got to do with the SBL again? The SBL is purely about what IP addresses "from which Spamhaus does not recommend the acceptance of electronic mail", nothing about websites. So that whole accusation feels wrong. Mixing up email sending servers and websites, domains and IPs, and absolutely no evidence for it at all.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3410426 href="vote?for=3410426&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%4c%72%32%61%65%43%68%42%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3410426></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=pg">pg</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3410426">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>"At the time the Spamhaus guys themselves didn't deny that they'd blacklisted large numbers of innocent Yahoo Store users. Their defense was that the end justified the means."<p>Putting this into context, this wouldn't have been the first step. This type of measure was typically implemented after it becomes increasingly clear that Yahoo would not, or could not, adopt measures to reduce the amount of spam coming from their mail servers.<p>One of Yahoo's general weaknesses is that it takes over 24 hours from sending a complaint until appropriate action is taken (that's why comments on their main sites - e.g. News - contains oodles of spam, and other types of abusive comments). On the typical life-cycle of email spam this is far too long - if a site is ever closed at that point, and so these abusive sites tend to still be up when the email recipient is clicking on those links. Closing a site after the damage has been done is just a never-ending game of whack-a-mole.<p>Blackholing bigger and bigger chunks of Yahoo Stores is then an escalating step until either Yahoo addresses the spam situation appropriately, or their customers see that Yahoo cannot sustainably provide the service customers are paying for and they either leave or seek legal remedies. At that point innocent customers are paying the price for living in a bad neighbourhood. The question is, why didn't Yahoo do a better job in controlling the level of abuse through Yahoo stores? That Spamhaus felt it necessary to escalate through to blocking chunks of ip addresses indicates Yahoo Stores fell significantly short of what was needed to reduce the spam coming from their servers. The indicative belief from the anti-spam community at that point is: it's mostly clear that the revenue generated from hosting spammers is more important to Yahoo Stores than being able to provide their innocent customers with the level of service they paid for.<p>From my perspective, SpamHaus were one of the cleaner, more diplomatic black lists around the time of the Yahoo Stores problem. It's been a few years since I last poked around in the anti-spam community. Last I've seen of Spamhaus they didn't defend a legal challenge in California raised by a confirmed spammer, because California doesn't have jurisdiction over UK-located organisations, and so the spammer got a default ruling in his favour ( <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/03/23/e360insight_lawsuit/" rel="nofollow">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/03/23/e360insight_lawsuit/</a> , <a href="http://www.spamhaus.org/organization/statement.lasso?ref=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.spamhaus.org/organization/statement.lasso?ref=3</a> ).</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=40></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3409304 href="vote?for=3409304&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%4c%72%32%61%65%43%68%42%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3409304></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=marcamillion">marcamillion</a> 35 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3409304">link</a></span></div><br>

Seems he forgot to mention the reasons why he still feels the need to badmouth Spamhaus (other than perhaps nothing better to do these years, lack of new ideas?).<p>Firstly, Paul's grand "A Plan for Spam" method of using Bayesian filters to stop all spam ("I think it's possible to stop spam, and that content-based filters are the way to do it.").  Uh, so, how'd that work out?  Spammers quickly figured out how to make a mockery of Bayes based solutions.  And who is still out there filtering spam using IP addresses &#38; domain names?  Spamhaus.<p>Then, what really got his goat was back in 2005 (yes, long grudge holding, one wonders what he feels about the mail-carrier who lost a letter of his back in '78 ;-) when his vanity site, shared-IP-hosted at Viaweb which had become Yahoo! Stores was blocklisted at Spamhaus.  Back then, Yahoo, and Yahoo Stores were a spammer-hosting cesspool and Paul's page was wallowing in the center of it.  Rather than get to the bottom of it, Paul just got on a high-horse and ranted about the evils of Spamhaus.  A good take on the rant can be read here:  <a href="http://www.circleid.com/posts/we_hate_spam_except_of_course_when_its_inconvenient_to_do_so/" rel="nofollow">http://www.circleid.com/posts/we_hate_spam_except_of_course_...</a><p>So, multiple biases.  How often people forget to mention those when they post attacks.  Now one must ask, who is the "bad guy" and is "corrupt" here?<p>But the Spamhaus people should be happy with the irony in Paul's hypocrisy.  How so?  Well, his paulgraham.com's email is filtered by Spamhaus, as is his ycombinator.com's email.  As are the emails of most of the social/blog sites he's on (posterous.com, etc.)  One wonder how many of these still use "A Plan for Spam"?  Okay, that was rhetorical.<p>Lastly, the pop-psychology in his posting attests that Paul's degrees are in philosophy, not psychology.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=80></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3410053 href="vote?for=3410053&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%4c%72%32%61%65%43%68%42%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3410053></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=CamperBob">CamperBob</a> 34 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3410053">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>These aren't just employees who signed these letters independently. They were asked by a client to sign onto the letter which agrees with the clients interests. They sign these precisely because the client of the firm <i>paid</i> them to. While I was at a firm we signed onto letters or drafted our own for clients all the time (and it was precisely b/c it helped get the laws through, so call it what you want -- i know I don't mind "support" though I can see how some object to the technicality). In laymen's terms, client shows up and says "we need this law to go through we'd like to hire a lawyer to write an <i>independent</i> legal opinion letter to the court to help them make their decision. Or maybe you guys can sign on to this guy's already written letter? We'll pay you for it, of course."<p>The techdirt article points this out too. When there's a law up for debate which a client wants to get through they try to get these letters in to make it more likely the law will pass. And yes this is different from official "support" which is saying "we the law firm want this law to pass." This is more like "our lawyer looked at this for our client and he does not think it's unconstitutional though this is not the position of the entire firm." To me, that's still bad but I completely understand if others are okay with it. Reasonable men can and do disagree about a lot of things.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=200></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3394714 href="vote?for=3394714&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%4c%72%32%61%65%43%68%42%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3394714></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=wtallis">wtallis</a> 38 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3394714">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I'm not talking about working hard at all; I think success pretty much always requires hard work of some kind. My friend definitely worked hard to get his business up and running and to the point where it supports him.<p>I'm talking about the idea that you have to work so hard that it threatens or consumes everything else in your life. And no one claims that doing that is sufficient, but a <i>lot</i> of people claim it's necessary.<p>It probably <i>is</i> necessary if the plan is to hit a billion-dollar exit in a few years. I just think that path entails a lot of extra risk that investors overwhelmingly benefit from, and founders end up paying for in the event that things go south. And sadly, I feel that a lot of investors essentially exploit young founders who don't know enough yet to know that they're paying a very high price for a 1/10000 chance at a grand slam (making $20m in 2-5 years), when they'd be better off in almost every way by going for the 1/10 or 1/100 base hit (making $2m in 5-10 years).<p>And to be clear, I'm not lumping YC in with most investors here.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Your reasoning exhibits another common fallacy.  While the average probability of making $20m in 5 years may be low, that doesn't imply each individual's is.  For the right sort of person the probability might be 2/3 or even higher.  For most people it's epsilon.

Maybe only 1 in 10000 (or whatever) people is over 7 feet tall.  But that doesn't mean your probability of being over 7 feet tall is .01%.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>But it is possible to tell which group you're in.  Nearly everyone correctly estimates their probability of making $20m in 5 years at a startup at near zero, and responds by not starting one.  A few people (e.g. Max Levchin) can with equal ease correctly estimate that the probability is high enough to make it worth doing.  There are only a few borderline cases of people who mistakenly believe they are the right sort of person to start a startup when they aren't.  They're overrepresented here, but they're a tiny fraction of the population.<p>Even if you're one of those people, you can do way better than falling back an average.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>You got a valid point. A a trick could be to focus on a problem, encounter many ideas (especially from other fields), and see if you could apply that idea to solve that problem. A problem that's hard for a technical person to solve could be trivial to someone who looks at it from a psychological point of view, and vice versa.<p>But the key is to always have a set of problems floating in your head.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>PG, I suspect that you'll do a better job of explaining why SOPA is bad than some other people, and you have more credibility than most, but taking a stand against SOPA by itself isn't enough.  The root cause of SOPA is a culture of piracy and a lack of participation by leaders in technology to develop better enforcement regulations.<p>Laws like SOPA are going to continue to be proposed until a better solution to copyright protection is enacted.  If we leave those proposals to be constructed by media companies who don't care as much about the integrity of the internet as they do about their bottom line, you'll just keep getting new laws that overreach and threaten our freedoms.  The fact that we're facing SOPA is bad, but it's the direct result of too many people pretending that copyright protection isn't an important issue that deserves better solutions, both by arguing against the rights of creators, and failing to proactively help create a better system of enforcement.<p>If you really want to do something powerful to stop SOPA-like legislation in its various forms, your essay should also aim to remind people that we're facing this legislation because people engage in piracy, and that we need leaders in the tech community to be more proactive about improving the DMCA if they want to have a voice in what shape copyright protection takes.  It might seem like SOPA is "the problem" but it's really one party's proposed solution to a very real issue.  An argument for why SOPA is bad without proposals about how to meet the needs of the party for whom SOPA is a solution only sends those people back to their misguided drawing board.<p>I respect the stand you've taken against SOPA.

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>- Transparency about the level to which companies infringe.<p>- Accountability for mass infringement and repeat violations.<p>- Rigid enforcement against companies who exist almost exclusively to provide access to illegal material.<p>There are two companies that need to be addressed:<p>You have companies whose businesses are primarily built on copyright infringing content that their users upload under DMCA.  Often small companies pop up who use this method until they're big enough to be noticed, and then they go back and negotiate retro-active deals.  This creates an unfair advantage for them over companies who choose to operate completely within the law.  These companies' only responsibility is to take the material down when they get caught, with no steeper penalty for repeat offenses or for building a business around this turnaround time.  Grooveshark is an example of an American company that falls into this category.<p>If you could see the number of takedown requests and repeat violations companies receive (I propose they be issued and resolved through a centralized database), it would be clear which companies exist almost exclusively to provide access to copyrighted material, or who do not place high enough priority on preventing copyright infringement.  I believe they need to be held accountable without placing the burden of pursuing civil penalties on the backs of individual or small company rights holders for whom a lawsuit is not equitable.  There should be severe penalties for companies whose infractions far outweigh the legitimate value they provide.  Those penalties should not require a class action lawsuit or the war chest of some large company.<p>Then there are companies who are just outright havens for illegal material, whether hosting it themselves or making user-shared content easy to find and access.  Most of these companies are offshore, or they are only providing links and information without providing the content itself, both of which makes it hard to pursue civil penalty.  I think there should be a clearly defined and transparent method for measuring the degree to which sites provide little value beyond access to illegal material, and those sites should be held accountable.  There has to be actionable recourse and, unfortunately, you can only pursue civil penalties from companies who are domestic (or in a participating country) or who actually profit from their actions.  In the case of sites who are not domestic or who do not generate meaningful financial gain for their illegal behavior, your only real option is to shut them down in one way or another.  If the criteria for a site being eligible for this type of action is clear, and the infraction history is transparent, I have a hard time justifying not taking action against them.  That being said, I do understand that we live in a world where rules are abused and I don't understand everything I need to about how such rules would be enforced.  But I don't think the the fact that it's difficult and not foolproof are good enough reasons not to pursue a better system.<p>The DMCA has put the burden of policing copyright on the shoulders of rights holders and that's fine, but penalizing companies who commit massive infringement should not be the job of a bunch of small artists and independent companies.  Then there are companies for whom the option of legal recourse is not an option, and those people should be handled in the strictest way possible without putting too much power in the hands of arbitrary organizations.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=160></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3390329 href="vote?for=3390329&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%4c%72%32%61%65%43%68%42%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3390329></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=RichardBennett">RichardBennett</a> 40 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3390329">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>I think it will detract from the discussion to get into whether or not copyright should be protected.  I think it's safe to say, and I hope you'll concede that, we're a long way away from abolishing copyright.  We're in a battle right now about whether Internet free speech is more important than copyright, so suffice it to say that there's going to be even less support for the idea that copyright isn't important at all.<p>With that in mind, let's assume we're looking at a decade or more before copyright would be abolished.  During that time, companies will have a strong argument for why a law should be enforced.  My point is that those people are going to keep proposing legislation that protects their interests.  We can either keep risking one of those overreaching bills passing and threatening things that are actually important to us, or we can work together to address piracy, something that we'd be foolish to defend over our other freedoms.<p>I'd like to see leaders in technology speak out against piracy and for the rights of content creators in the same breath as they say this is not the legislation we need.  You're going to get more support from media if you acknowledge that there is a serious problem and offer to help address it than if all they ever see from the tech community are comments in forums about how information should be free and we should just abolish copyright.  If that's what they're hearing, they're just going to keep pushing for the legislation they want and ignore the opinions of others.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=120></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3390086 href="vote?for=3390086&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%4c%72%32%61%65%43%68%42%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3390086></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=tptacek">tptacek</a> 40 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3390086">link</a></span></div><br>

In practice the authors wouldn't have to carry all the load for the business model innovation; there would be third parties that figure it out and play a role analogous to the role currently played by publishers, e.g. there could be a company similar to kickstarter dedicated to helping authors fund their projects.<p>We're in early days right now, so the old models still do have a large market share, but we need to be forward-looking and consider the long-run effects.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3390342 href="vote?for=3390342&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%4c%72%32%61%65%43%68%42%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3390342></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=_dps">_dps</a> 40 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3390342">link</a></span></div><br>
<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>People certainly get attached to their historical revenues, but let's not forget that businesses like books, movies, and music all have hit-dominated economics under the current model and that this has co-evolved with the kinds of products that are available. Cutting the potential upside of the big hits does disproportionate damage to the overall industry's expected returns. I know you were specifically discussing books where initial production costs are low (in comparison to marketing), but consider what happens to film and television.<p>As you say, under a new regime without copyright as-is, new people may come in to fill the void. However, they may not be real replacements for the old-media dinosaurs. If it becomes impossible to try to make something like "Lost" with any reasonable expectation of a return, then products as complex and expensive as "Lost" simply won't get made. We should be cognizant of this kind of tradeoff as policy evolves.<p>I think the recent story about Louis C.K. points out one possible angle of filling the void; it's comparatively cheap for him to try a stunt like that. Generally, things produced by individuals with relatively little "refinement" (sound, graphics, costumes, marketing, etc.) seem like good candidates for business model innovation. On the other hand, the pilot episode of "Lost" cost millions of dollars just in production (i.e. before they even had any idea if it would be popular and got a marketing budget). If we want a new regime that still allows such projects to be undertaken, Kickstarter-like services and "Please just pay me $5" probably aren't going to cut it (no disrespect to Kickstarter or Louis). I don't know if, in the context of big budget projects, they even represent a meaningful step toward a solution.</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=320></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3390424 href="vote?for=3390424&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%4c%72%32%61%65%43%68%42%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3390424></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=jey">jey</a> 40 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3390424">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Completely agree that the questions should be asked honestly and with an eye on social benefits and costs. I'm no fan of the copyright system as-is precisely because I think those tradeoffs are poorly balanced given modern technology.<p>As for whether it is "bad" to lose capacity to do things like "Lost" I think (for my value system) it's clearly very bad even if 9/10 such projects are not of lasting value. These kinds of mega-projects allow us to push the frontier of what is possible as entertainment and human expression. If you don't particularly like "Lost" for artistic reasons (fair enough ;-), then perhaps substitute anything by Pixar; losing society's ability to make "Wall-E" or "Up" means a duller, less inspiring world.<p>Of course, you could similarly disagree with the artistic merits of Pixar films as being a worthwhile tradeoff. But at some point that line of reasoning just becomes "I'm personally happy with art made on the cheap by a small group and no marketing or distribution costs; I'm ok sacrificing everything else."</font></span><p><font size=1><font color=#f6f6ef>-----</font></font></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><table border=0><tr><td><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/s.gif" height=1 width=280></td><td valign=top><center><a id=up_3390324 href="vote?for=3390324&dir=up&whence=%2f%78%3f%66%6e%69%64%3d%6f%4c%72%32%61%65%43%68%42%37"><img src="http://ycombinator.com/images/grayarrow.gif" border=0 vspace=3 hspace=2></a><span id=down_3390324></span></center></td><td class="default"><div style="margin-top:2px; margin-bottom:-10px; "><span class="comhead"><a href="user?id=earbitscom">earbitscom</a> 40 days ago  | <a href="item?id=3390324">link</a></span></div><br>

<span class="comment"><font color=#000000>Before you write an essay on SOPA, it would probably be a good idea to get a really solid handle on what it does and doesn't do.

(hint: the answer is "yes" as long as redirection isn't required.)<p>Does SOPA include language protecting DNSSEC?<p>What due process protections does SOPA have for domain blacklisting?<p>Does SOPA apply to US-based sites?<p>How much of a burden does SOPA compliance place in ISPs, ad networks, credit card processors, and search engines?<p>Are Internet firms registered in .com and/or based in the United States that are not in the category above (payments, ads, search, ISPs) have anything to fear from SOPA?
